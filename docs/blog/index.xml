      <description>After an absence of over seven years, the old Argolon Blog, which was active from 2005 until 2010, is back online. This is really just for posterity and to ensure the history of this Irish startup remains accessible for the foreseeable future. We hope you enjoy browsing and having a chuckle over posts like our 2009 predictions.</description>

      <description>The LouderVoice customer reviews system for business has moved into high-gear in 2009. Clients are deploying our EasyReview widget on their e-commerce sites every week. Our first US customer will go live this month along with many more Irish sites. Our second UK site will go live early in the new year.
The most recent research by Internet Retailer tells you everything you need to know about how important reviews are to businesses.</description>

      <title>BarCamp Cork III Next Weekend</title>

      <description>As co-organiser of the first two Cork BarCamps, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to see the third one is happening next Saturday 14th Nov in the fabulous Cork International Airport Hotel. The able organisers this time around are Gordon Murray, Ciara Crossan and Ciara Feely.
BarCamp is one of those free conferences where you leave having gained far more from the day than you expect. It&amp;rsquo;s the serendipity that makes it special. I have built many friendships and business relationships with the people I meet there over the years.</description>

      <title>Getting a HTC Hero on Meteor this Monday?</title>

      <description>You won&amp;rsquo;t regret it. Even my old clunky HTC G1 with the latest bleeding edge community firmware is now a great phone. Be sure to buy some spare batteries on eBay tho.
Well bloody done Meteor for being first to launch an Android phone in Ireland. Three seems to have dropped the ball with launches recently (possibly due to all effort going into the National Broadband scheme) and this is a real coup for one of the smaller mobile operators.</description>

      <title>So Twitter is just for mindless prattle eh?</title>

      <description>Every so often, Twitter surprises me. When you think you&amp;rsquo;ve had enough of the consultants, snake oil salesmen, link baiters and spammers, someone uses it to blow your socks off with great customer service. Drugstore.com just did that for me.
I make maybe two large orders a year from drugstore.com which is based in the US (and owned by Amazon I think). The main purchase is a generic OTC medicine which costs a ridiculous fortune in Ireland in branded form.</description>

      <title>CIO For Ireland</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2009/10/10/cio-for-ireland/</link>

      <guid>https://argolon.com/2009/10/10/cio-for-ireland/</guid>
      <description>The new Programme for Government has been announced by the coalition in Ireland and one of the most important aspects of it is the announcement of the position of CIO. Whilst you might think this is only of interest to those who work in technology, I think it has the potential to be a critical role in preparing the country for renewal.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing a CIO with real teeth and real vision who understands that information is power and power should be given to as many people as possible.</description>

      <title>West Cork OpenCoffee</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2009/09/29/west-cork-opencoffee/</link>

      <guid>https://argolon.com/2009/09/29/west-cork-opencoffee/</guid>
      <description>I founded Cork OpenCoffee back in early 2007 and I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to see it grow to be the most successful OCC in Ireland. The bulk of the organising is now done by Gordon Murray of Murrion Software and Ciara Crossan of Weddingdates.
A few months back OpenCoffee Mallow launched and by all accounts is going really well. Their next meet-up is in Springfort Hall, on Tuesday the 6th of October, from 10 am until approx 12 pm.</description>
