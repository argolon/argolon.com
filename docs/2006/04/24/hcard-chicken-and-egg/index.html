                <p><a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hCard</a> is one of the two main microformats that one sees mentioned (the other being <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hCalendar</a>). There was an interesting discussion on it in the <a href="http://www.talkcrunch.com/2006/03/19/episode-2-social-networks-30/">second Talkcrunch podcast</a>. Reid Hoffman of <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn.com</a> was asked why they did not support hCard. He made the simple point that they only implement features on the site which give near-immediate benefit to their users. hCard, like many of the microformats is in the chicken and egg situation where it needs someone to take a leap of faith, build some unique applications around hCard and the other microformats and then push that to seed the creation and use of microformatted data.</p>
<p>Our belief that microformats could underpin a whole new breed of applications and services grows stronger by the day. With the right funding, a startup could really drive the adoption of microformats, particularly on non-traditional end-user platforms. By using open straightforward standards, they could usurp many of the current walled-garden approaches, to the benefit of both end-users and themselves.</p>
<p>As I am discussing hCard, I should point out that I&rsquo;ve updated the Argolon contact page to hCard format. This can be done very easily by anyone over at the <a href="http://microformats.org/code/hcard/creator">microformats</a> web-site. There is a link on the contact page allowing you to simply save off the contact details as a VCF file which Outlook etc can easily import.</p>
