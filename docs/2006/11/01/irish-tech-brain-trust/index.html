<p>Have a good read of the post and a good think about the practicalities of it and please post your thoughts over on his blog. I really see this as complementary to the EI Mentor scheme and the services of the various BICs around the country. I can think of a bunch of people who would have so much to offer here and not just those who have &ldquo;made it&rdquo; already.</p>
<p>I know I&rsquo;ve found the advice of others in Irish start-ups to be absolutely invaluable and I&rsquo;d be struggling to get anywhere if it wasn&rsquo;t for the pointers and help they have given me. You know who you are! Others may not be as lucky as I am to have easy access to such top notch people and something like The Brain Trust could be a big help in getting them moving on their ideas.</p>
<p>Now what do we do to get started on this? And I don&rsquo;t mean that we look at Damien expectantly. Do we need a virtual BrainTrustCamp (BrainCamp is taken)?</p>
