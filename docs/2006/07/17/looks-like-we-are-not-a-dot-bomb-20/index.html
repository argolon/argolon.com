<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Have a revenue model, right now</strong>.  We have two, the early model and the live-n-kicking model. I wouldn&rsquo;t have got into this otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be a complete business, not just a feature</strong>. Yes, completely covered. We ask the same question over and over: &ldquo;why will people use our site?&rdquo;. And the answers are solid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Affect real people, not just bloggers</strong>.  Amen, brother. Our business plan has been given to more non-techies than techies. Only one blogger has seen it. All of them <em>got</em> it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>4.** Get a real, memorable name**.  Ah shucks, and I just registered FlimFlamFoodle. We actually took two English words which mean something and jammed them together. Very old fashioned but totally memorable. Beats Argolon anyway ;-)</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>If applicable, get unaffiliated with Web 2.0, because it is hype and will have a very negative backlash in a little while</strong>.  The word-police are out in force again and I&rsquo;m getting tired of it. We&rsquo;ll describe our business in terms that are familiar to whoever we are talking to. If Web 2.0 is familiar then that is what we&rsquo;ll use, if &ldquo;one of those there web-site doo-dahs&rdquo; is what gets the message across then doo-dah it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Find some friends who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t drink the kool-aid and get their honest feedback</strong>. This should be everyone&rsquo;s first step. My first port of call was a 67-year old technophobe. Handed him the concept document and said &ldquo;read this and tell me if you have any idea what I&rsquo;m talking about&rdquo;. He got 95% of it. Next port of call was EI, they challenged lots of it but they also got it. Every person who constructively criticises just makes the plan stronger and stronger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are revolutionary, make sure that a revolution is coming</strong>.  We are more evolutionary but we still have to make judgement calls on the speed of some technology uptakes. Metrics, metrics, metrics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If you are evolutionary, then there needs to be a big enough market to address with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re a little better than themÃ¢â‚¬Â vision</strong>.  Our evolution is to take an existing successful business model and go about it in a far more scalable way. We are orders of magnitude better not a little better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fit your business into an existing food chain</strong>.  We slot in just nicely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not expect to be Google and, just as importantly, do not expect them to buy you</strong>. Nah, but strive to be them. You&rsquo;ll get nowhere without ambition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ignore the hype and have fun</strong>. Most fun I&rsquo;ve had in business in 10 years.</p>
</li>
