            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I recently passed comment that the <a href="http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/">Juice podcast receiver</a> could not see the MP3&rsquo;s embedded in <a href="http://tantek.com/log/2006/06.html#d19t1547">Tantek&rsquo;s feed</a>. I assumed wrongly that there was something wrong with the feed. But he pointed out that Juice must not support ATOM 1.0 yet. From what I can see, development on Juice has stalled which is a pity as it is a fine tool.</p>
<p>Tantek says that iTunes 6.0 does support ATOM 1.0 but that is no good to me as I refuse to install software which is built on the basis of controlling users. However I have had no success finding an alternative. I looked at both <a href="http://www.jpodder.com/">JPodder</a> and <a href="http://www.dopplerradio.net/">Doppler</a> but they rejected the feed too. Only <a href="http://podcatcher.rubyforge.org/">Armangil&rsquo;s podcatcher</a> seems to support it but that is a CLI tool which just sounds like too much hard work.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a Windows podcatcher which does support ATOM 1.0 along with the usual RSS? Need the standard unsupervised downloads etc as features.</p>
<p>UPDATE 1: I&rsquo;ve also looked at standard feedreaders like <a href="http://www.blogbridge.com">Blogbridge</a> and <a href="http://www.awasu.com">Awasu</a>. Neither of them can even parse Tantek&rsquo;s feed. The feed gives some errors in the feed validator but only trivial ones so the problem looks to be at the reader end. Awasu is a nice looking piece of software and does have auto-download of enclosures which is all I really need.</p>
<p>UPDATE 2: I needed to upgrade Awasu to the latest beta for ATOM 1.0 support. It can now see Tantek&rsquo;s and Tim Bray&rsquo;s feeds perfectly. In fact, it now proves that Bloglines is making a complete mess of displaying Tantek&rsquo;s. Next to see if the enclosures are downloaded ok.</p>
