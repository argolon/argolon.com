                <p>I watched with great dismay this week as <a href="http://www.peopleaggregator.net/user.php?tier_one=mypage&amp;uid=267">PeopleAggregator</a> launched and created a swirl of negative comment due to the slightly spammy nature of Marc Canter&rsquo;s invites to anyone who had ever mailed him. I have huge respect for Marc and his vision, passion, directness and energy but he really made a pigs ear of the launch. Instead of everyone discussing all of the possibilities created by PeepAg, the buzz just fizzled almost immediately.</p>
<p>I had been asking myself how they can regain the momentum in terms of getting people involved and excited but luckily <a href="http://www.horsepigcow.com/2006/06/community-building-takes-patience.html">Tara Hunt has answered that</a>. Marc is a customer of hers and she lists a wonderful set of rules for operating in this space.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<ol>
<li>be patient</li>
<li>be part of the community you serve</li>
<li>build something amazing and they will come</li>
<li>SPAM means that if someone hasn&rsquo;t expressed interest explicitly (i.e. signed up, then opted in to receive emails), don&rsquo;t send email</li>
<li>it&rsquo;s all in the organic growth&hellip;that means 100% natural</li>
<li>limit outgoing messages altogether, unless they are incredibly personal</li>
<li>work with the grassroots, not against it</li>
<li>concentrate on individual relationships, not mass messaging</li>
<li>involve the community early on in the development process</li>
<li>trust is the new currency&hellip;if you spend it, you can&rsquo;t replenish it - it&rsquo;s a valuable, non-renewable resource</li>
<li>be patient</li>
</ol>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I think these rules will be quoted over and over in the coming year. I&rsquo;ve printed them out and stuck them to my wall. We are in the very early days of building what I hope will be a globally successful product. Up until Monday I had thought about the launch and initial growth of the product in general terms but the stumbling of PeepAg means that rule number 9 in particular moves to the top of my list.</p>
