<p>Hmm, I&rsquo;m about to insert some inline HTML, will that work?</p>

<p>For the life of me I cannot find the RSS feeds (neither can Livelines) even tho one person has stated where they are</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flickr now working - thanks to some helpful Paggregators (Paggers?). Use your email address, not your Flickr ID or Yahoo login</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whilst there are obviously Microformats in the Structured Blogging posts and Flocktails picked up my review of PeopleAggregator itself, it doesn&rsquo;t see a hCard on my public page. Does it exist?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No rich text editing controls in the blog posts. No loss really but it will keep the geek quotient high</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What services are being pinged when we blog?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did a review on PA itself but it forgot my OutputThis settings so it never appeared over at <a href="http://argolon.com/">Argolon</a>. You can <a href="http://www.peopleaggregator.net/content.php?cid=1232">find it here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does it time out and force me to re-login?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It would be nice if the permalinks and general navigation structure used my ID somewhere in the path</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I assume a ton of different export features will come as the site heads towards full release</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The thing that really works for me overall is that I am not a MySpace user or a Bebo User or an Orkut User. I&rsquo;m a Flickr, Structured Blogging, Technorati, Wordpress, Google, sxore, del.icio.us, ma.gnolia, ClaimID user. If I can have one place which gives me Read/Write access to all of those services from one place and uses that information to enable and create intelligent links and relationships to other users like a LinkedIn on steroids, then I&rsquo;ll never leave.</p>
