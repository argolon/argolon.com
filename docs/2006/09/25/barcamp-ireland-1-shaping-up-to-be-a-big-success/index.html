                <p>We are really excited with the energy that is building around the first <a href="http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland">BarCampIreland</a>. At one point we wondered if we&rsquo;d get 40 people turning up. It is now at 103 with everyone from college students to technology gurus to VCs signed up. This mix is critical to having a rich and varied day for everyone.</p>
<p>We are wrapping up a lot of the loose ends this week but overall it looks like everything is in place for a great day in <a href="http://www.webworkscork.com/">WebWorks</a>. The sponsors have been very generous with both money and time and the event really benefits from having them on board.</p>
<p>Having said all of that, the success of the day is really dependent on having an enthusiastic set of speakers. We are now up to 20 but we&rsquo;d love to see more. As we said <a href="https://argolon.com/BarCampIreland/blog">over at the blog</a>, if you don&rsquo;t want to do a full 30 minute session then consider <a href="http://argolon.com/BarCampIreland/blog/2006/09/17/fantastic-idea-for-a-session/">the Petcha Kucha session</a> which only requires 20 seconds talk on each of 20 slides. If you don&rsquo;t like public speaking then maybe do a live demo of some technology or tool that you love. Also, please continue to suggest topics you would like to hear.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all in Cork on Saturday.</p>
