      <title>CIO For Ireland</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2009/10/10/cio-for-ireland/</link>

      <description>The new Programme for Government has been announced by the coalition in Ireland and one of the most important aspects of it is the announcement of the position of CIO. Whilst you might think this is only of interest to those who work in technology, I think it has the potential to be a critical role in preparing the country for renewal.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing a CIO with real teeth and real vision who understands that information is power and power should be given to as many people as possible.</description>

      <title>Sometimes Life Sux</title>

      <description>Just a quick mention of a neat new app that launched recently called LifeSux daily. It was developed by the same guy who now does all the heavy lifting on LouderVoice. It is another example of high speed development using Python and Django like the recently launched Matt.
The ideas is simple:
We designed LifeSuxDaily.com to let you share, with the community, those situations when you start feeling that life is a bitch and let you die ;) and get its feedback through comments and votes.</description>

      <title>Outcome of testing Mobile Broadband (O2 and Vodafone)</title>

      <description>This is actually a combined review of O2 and Vodafone Ireland mobile broadband services since I tested them in parallel. Neither is a replacement for fixed-line BB but in certain situations, the O2 modem is extremely fast and was my winner overall.
I&amp;rsquo;ve railed against both O2 and Voda on repeated occasions for not offering decent value proper data plans on phones. I&amp;rsquo;ve also read a wide variety of opinions on the various mobile broadband offferings with Three getting the most abuse.</description>

      <title>Student Enterprise Winners</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work recently for the County and City Enterprise Boards and have been finding out about the Student Enterprise Awards. I am so incredibly jealous of today&amp;rsquo;s teenagers, I would have loved to be involved in something like that in school.
Approx 12000 students take part every year and some great ideas bubble to the top every time. They just had the 2008 awards ceremony last week and Banagher College from Co.</description>

      <title>Joining Genesis Enterprise Programme</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re really excited at Argolon HQ to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve been accepted on to the Genesis Enterprise Programme. We&amp;rsquo;ve had lots of dealings with both the Rubicon Centre and GEP over the past year through Cork OpenCoffee and have been thoroughly impressed with the whole operation.
I&amp;rsquo;ve presented LouderVoice to Denise Kennedy, who runs GEP, twice over the past 18 months. I can honestly say it didn&amp;rsquo;t go well the first time.</description>

      <title>Protect your laptop or mobile phone</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to see that the YouGetItBack guys have launched the Beta versions of Laptop Superhero and Mobile Superhero (love the branding!). These are applications you install and are activated when your device is lost or stolen. For the well-intentioned finder, the app tells them how to contact YGIB so that they can return the device to you. For the badly-intentioned finder, it locks the devices down so they cannot be used.</description>

      <title>Any precedents on Libel and Defamation Law for Bloggers in Ireland?</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2008/04/18/any-precedents-on-libel-and-defamation-law-for-bloggers-in-ireland/</link>

      <description>Mike Butcher has just published a very useful piece on how to protect yourself as a blogger if you write something that results in a libel action being mounted against you and your content. It is all based around &amp;ldquo;The Reynolds defense of Responsible Journalism&amp;rdquo;. Whilst it makes total sense to me as a lay-person, it clearly is only directly relevant to UK bloggers.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s generally felt that Irish libel law is even more ridiculous than that of the UK, I wonder if there are any similar cases/precedents that apply here?</description>

      <title>Joining it@cork Steering Committee</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve joined the it@cork steering committee. Since we founded Argolon Solutions, I&amp;rsquo;ve always found it@cork to be the real stand-out organisation nationally. I know other cities would love to replicate its success. It has always managed to strike that balance between meeting the needs of established IT organisations and the needs of start-ups.
I&amp;rsquo;ve already attended my first meeting and I was blown away by how much work is done by the committee and the various sub-committees.</description>

      <title>Weathering a blogstorm</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2008/04/18/weathering-a-blogstorm/</link>

      <guid>https://argolon.com/2008/04/18/weathering-a-blogstorm/</guid>
      <description>One aspect of blogging (particularly business blogging) that worries some people is when something negative is written about them. This can sometimes erupt into a blogstorm with a huge hullabaloo across multiple blogs. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few over the past few years and each company/person handled it differently.
Frank Prendergast has written a very thoughtful post on this topic and I&amp;rsquo;ll be recommending it to all new (and old!) bloggers. The essence of his advice is to keep a level head, state your case, apologise if you are in the wrong and move on.</description>

      <title>OpenBBQ in Tipperary?</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2008/04/06/openbbq-in-tipperary/</link>

      <description>Cross-posting from the Cork OpenCoffee Blog: What started as a discussion about having an OpenCoffee in the Midlands the other day quickly turned into a proposal for an OpenBBQ in Terryglass on Lough Derg this summer.
Think business networking, free Wifi, top class BBQ and fun.
Evert has all the details so far. Please drop him a line if you think you might go. He’s thinking June/July mid-week. If there is enough interest from Cork OpenCoffee we could consider hiring a mini-bus?</description>
