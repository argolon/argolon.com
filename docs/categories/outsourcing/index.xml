      <description>I have huge respect for Munjal Shah of Riya and I was pretty gob-smacked to read his most recent blog post announcing that they are shutting their Bangalore office and centralising all development in Silicon Valley. His reasons are compelling, particularly for a start-up, even a well funded one.
When we started our outsourcing search last July, we were open to getting the work done anywhere. I&amp;rsquo;d just had some good experiences in working with remote teams in China and India.</description>

      <title>ShareIT Presentation</title>

      <description>The first ShareIT session was held yesterday in UCC. Unfortunately I had to leave early but I did catch Jenny Kent&amp;rsquo;s and Krishna De&amp;rsquo;s presentations both of which were excellent and full of practical nuggets rather than generalities. This is a genuinely valuable initiative for those starting out in tech businesses. I highly recommend attending the next one in Dublin on April 28th in the Microsoft offices.
My presentation on &amp;ldquo;Oursourcing - A Guide&amp;rdquo; is here as a PDF.</description>

      <description>Ryan Carson has a good post on outsourcing in the context of DropSend and Amigo. I like his metrics on when to know you are in trouble. His Russian approach is interesting but as he points out, you have to know someone who knows the local scene to do it comfortably.
I&amp;rsquo;ll update our progress here with outsourcing with part three in our series (part 1, part 2) when I get back from FoWA.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re putting together a simple landing page for the new business whilst we are still in development. It became clear to us recently that we needed a logo for that to give a sense of identity and also to direct the initial colour scheme of the prototype.
I have always liked the idea of sits like RentACoder and Elance for small bits of work but had never tried them. Anthony, down in Ummera, recently asked me for advice on a site re-design he was considering.</description>

      <description>When I decided to launch the new business, one of the first decisions I made was to outsource as many of the activities as possible. I spent 14 years providing design services and professional services in a variety of industries so it is something I am entirely comfortable with.
The main areas are obviously software development, graphic design and datacenter operations. To me it it no different than getting a lawyer to do your legals or an accountant to do the books.</description>
