      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling with Vista on a Dell D420 laptop recently. It is described as &amp;ldquo;Vista Capable&amp;rdquo;. It is nothing of the sort. So tonight I reverted back to XP Pro and have started the long slow re-install of all my favourite applications. This is what I pretty much always install on XP machines now:
 Windows XP SP2 plus all updates Internet Explorer 7 Firefox (plus some standard add-ons) KeePass password manager Nokia N-Series PC Suite PDFCreator AVG Anti-Virus Microsoft Office 2007 Adobe Acrobat Reader Pidgin Instant Messenger Filezilla FTP Client Skype OpenOffice Sun Java JDK Putty SSH Client MySQL Tools Adobe Flash Adobe Shockwave (no idea why I need this!</description>

      <title>Movable Type - Not there yet</title>

      <description>There has been some new buzz about Movable Type since version 4 was released a while back. I had carried out one install of v3 previously to ensure that we supported it ok in LouderVoice. It was one of the worst install experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to build XEmacs from source on Windows. V3 made me realise why Wordpress had left MT eating its dust. The WP boast of a 5 minute install was not an empty one and it &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; out of the box in most cases.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking recently about Nokia and my general feeling is that they are missing many simple opportunities to retain leadership in mobile development.
Apart from one crappy Panasonic and a dog-slow Sony-Ericcson T610, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Nokia phones. They have been solid workhorses with just the right combination of features for me. Until last year, that meant Series 40 phones but I then finally succumbed and bought an N70 a year ago.</description>

      <title>Decent podcast player for Nokia N70?</title>

      <description>Can anyone recommend a decent podcast player for my phone? The built-in music player is a bad joke and only suitable for playing 3 minute songs - it has no ability to jump directly to a position in an MP3. It&amp;rsquo;s use of Spanish in the status messages is also interesting.
Ideally I want something that has decent navigation capabilities within a podcast. If I could bookmark my positions in individual MP3s so I could quickly return to where I was listening, that would be awesome too.</description>
