      <description>As co-organiser of the first two Cork BarCamps, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to see the third one is happening next Saturday 14th Nov in the fabulous Cork International Airport Hotel. The able organisers this time around are Gordon Murray, Ciara Crossan and Ciara Feely.
BarCamp is one of those free conferences where you leave having gained far more from the day than you expect. It&amp;rsquo;s the serendipity that makes it special. I have built many friendships and business relationships with the people I meet there over the years.</description>

      <description>I founded Cork OpenCoffee back in early 2007 and I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to see it grow to be the most successful OCC in Ireland. The bulk of the organising is now done by Gordon Murray of Murrion Software and Ciara Crossan of Weddingdates.
A few months back OpenCoffee Mallow launched and by all accounts is going really well. Their next meet-up is in Springfort Hall, on Tuesday the 6th of October, from 10 am until approx 12 pm.</description>

      <guid>https://argolon.com/2008/08/04/seedcamp-prep-session/</guid>
      <description>Given the interest expressed in having a SeedCamp prep session, Gordon Murray has arranged a room in Oriel House Hotel in Ballincollig, Cork for Thursday August 7th starting at 9am.
It will be quite informal, the aim is to get practical advice from each other on answering some of the questions on the application form so that you promote your business or idea as best as possible.
He’ll have printouts of the questions with him on the day.</description>

      <description>Pix.ie is often compared to Yahoo&amp;rsquo;s Flickr and understandably so, but it offers a far more impressive and friendly user interface. Once they launch their public API, they should be unstoppable.
There are a LOT of photo sharing sites out there. It&amp;rsquo;s an area I haven&amp;rsquo;t dug too deeply into over the years as my needs are quite simple. I want somewhere that allows me to easily upload cameraphone pics and screenshots, set the privacy so that my family doesn&amp;rsquo;t need an account to view them and allows me to display some of those pics in a variety of sizes on my blogs.</description>

      <title>The Tuesday Push - Do it!</title>

      <description>Cross-posted from Web2Ireland:
Damien Mulley gets community like very few other people in the industry. His ideas are always worth listening to and, more importantly, worth acting on. He has just kicked off a real corker called The Tuesday Push. Every second Tuesday, a startup is selected from those who put themselves forward and lots of us blog about them on the same day.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of those simple but potentially incredibly powerful ways of getting us all noticed.</description>

      <description>Jaiku Invites is a great initiative from Ciarán Rooney. When Google bought Jaiku they shut down new user registrations. There are a lot of people out there who would love to join and take part in all the great discussions we have there, particularly around events like OpenCoffee and BarCamps. Luckily each existing member was given 10 invites that they could hand out.
The purpose of Jaiku Invites is to hook these two groups of people together.</description>

      <title>Do you know of any free Wifi Hotspots?</title>

      <description>James Corbett is building a map of Wifi Hotspots around the country. Whilst they can be free or non-free, I hope we can identify as many free ones as possible first. I&amp;rsquo;ve added the ones I know of in Cork and indicated whether they are publicly accessible locations or not.

If you know of any, please spread the love and add a push-pin to the map. You should also include any FON hotspots that you know of.</description>
