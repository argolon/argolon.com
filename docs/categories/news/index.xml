      <description>As of November 2024, LouderVoice and Argolon Solutions Ltd have ceased operations. We would like to thank our many loyal customers for their support over the years. We are proud of the service we provided, the many reviews we helped generate and the businesses we helped along the way.
The LouderVoice API ran continuously with over 6 nines of reliability from 2008 until 2024.
Please feel free to look back over our blog posts and news, beginning in June 2005.</description>

      <description>After an absence of over seven years, the old Argolon Blog, which was active from 2005 until 2010, is back online. This is really just for posterity and to ensure the history of this Irish startup remains accessible for the foreseeable future. We hope you enjoy browsing and having a chuckle over posts like our 2009 predictions.</description>
