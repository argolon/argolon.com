      <title>Structured Blogging is back</title>

      <description>The SB site and mailing-list used to be hosted by PubSub which sadly gone to the big internet archive in the sky. The guys have now moved these over to Marc Canter&amp;rsquo;s BBM site and things are back up and running. Not only that but they&amp;rsquo;ve done a new code drop which I will be installing here shortly.
Whilst SB has had a tortured existence over the past 9 months, there is still a big window of opportunity for it to gain far more interest.</description>

      <title>it@cork Web2.0 Conference - Salim Ismail</title>

      <description>it@cork Web2.0 Conference Event type: Conference
Date: 2006-06-08
Rating: 5 out of 5
Salim gave a suberb presentation which for me, as expected, was the highlight of the conference. I have heard chunks of the presentation on various Podcasts and it is still very focused on the ideas they built in PubSub despite the fact that Salim left there several months back. But given that those ideas remain as relevant now as they were when PubSub was founded, the presentation was compelling.</description>

      <title>Nice movie of a microformat-aware application</title>

      <description>Drew McLellan has done a short movie showing how to go from subscribing to someone&amp;rsquo;s RSS feed which contains hCalendar events using a microformat-aware reader to importing that into iCal with just a few clicks. And of course it doesn&amp;rsquo;t just have to be into iCal. Simple, powerful.

      <title>Web 2.0 Conference Dublin - much food for thought</title>

      <description>The Web 2.0 Conference in Dublin was a big success and was well worth attending. It was great to finally put faces to a lot of names in the Irish tech world and beyond. I went out the previous night to an informal meet-up arranged by Robert Smith. The layout of the place unfortunately was not conducive to talking to lots of the people who turned up which meant I didn&amp;rsquo;t get to talk to Marc Canter about Microformats and Structured Blogging until the following day.</description>

      <title>The four steps to uF and SB adoption</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2006/04/25/the-four-steps-to-uf-and-sb-adoption/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about how we can move microformats and structured blogging from the realm of interesting but niche to ubiquity. There are four obvious steps that most technologies go through before they gain widespread acceptance.
[1] Initial concept - The microformat guys have the core concepts and standards nailed. The SB guys rightly use standards rather than creating them and their vision for SB is very clear.
[2] Reference Implementation - Apart from rel=tag, which has been an enormous success due to Technorati itself, most of the other uF tools seem to be either quick hacks or programmers trying things out on hCard.</description>

      <title>Google Calendar vs hCalendar</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2006/04/19/google-calendar-vs-hcalendar/</link>

      <description>It is very disappointing that there is a &amp;ldquo;vs&amp;rdquo; in the title of this post instead of a &amp;ldquo;supports&amp;rdquo;. Google Calendar does not have any support for microformats (uF) but this is pretty much standard behaviour for them recently. Given the resources available to them and the great applications that could be built on the back of uF + Google Calendar, their short term thinking and half-baked recent releases are becoming harder and harder to forgive.</description>

      <title>hCalendar, Google Calendar and Greasemonkey</title>

      <description>On my personal blog, I discuss structured blogging and microformats quite a bit, but usually in the context of things like food. However, the opportunities being presented by microformats apply in many different spheres. It is surprising how few startups seem to be building compelling applications using them.
To take one example, online calendars are now two a penny. In many cases there is little to choose between them. Most recently, I have found Airset to be the most functional from an integration to Phone/Palm/etc perspective.</description>
