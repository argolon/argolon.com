      <description>As co-organiser of the first two Cork BarCamps, I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to see the third one is happening next Saturday 14th Nov in the fabulous Cork International Airport Hotel. The able organisers this time around are Gordon Murray, Ciara Crossan and Ciara Feely.
BarCamp is one of those free conferences where you leave having gained far more from the day than you expect. It&amp;rsquo;s the serendipity that makes it special. I have built many friendships and business relationships with the people I meet there over the years.</description>

      <description>It has been over two years since the last one, but BarCamp is finally coming back to Cork. It&amp;rsquo;s soon, very soon, only four weeks away. The venue is the lovely Webworks building in the City Centre, just like the last time.
We have a strong vision for this event and we need your help to make it happen on the day. Please read the first set of posts and give us your feedback.</description>

      <description>Haydn has offered up some quite controversial opinions on where many Irish web companies should put their energies and also what the BarCampDublin focus should be. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;d like to see argued from both points of view so please head over to Mediangler and offer your thoughts.</description>

      <description>Elly and the gang have been hard at work putting together BarCamp Dublin and it looks like a winner. This is the third one after Cork and Waterford and I love the look of the speaker line-up. If you are free at all on Saturday week I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to head over. Do sign-up so they know how many people to expect.
Some of the talks that catch my eye include:</description>

      <description>I attended my first UK Geek Dinner last night after FoWA. Guests of honour were Tara Hunt and Chris Messina. I only chatted to Chris for a short while towards the end of the night and the bulk of the conversation was about BarCamp. I told him how important I thought BarCamps have been for the creation of a vibrant tech community in Ireland. I also wanted to thank him and Tantek and the others for starting something that I think is a true revolution.</description>
