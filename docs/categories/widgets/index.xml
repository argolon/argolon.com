      <description>Not just because it is a brilliant product but also because Lenny, Jonathan and the guys have shown that small Irish technology companies can have global reach!
These guys pushed out 14 million polls last month and over half of them were non-English-language.
Vote early and often.</description>

      <description>After some hand-holding from Ivan, I got Snipperoo working on my personal blog. The basic misunderstanding I had was that I thought all the widgets shown in the help screens were pre-existing ones I could add to my panel with one click whereas in fact you have to create each one by hand. This sounds awkward but isn&amp;rsquo;t. Just take the normal snippet of code you would use to show that widget on your blog and paste it into a new &amp;ldquo;module&amp;rdquo; in Snipperoo.</description>

      <description>I love the idea of Snipperoo and widgets in general. There is of course the conflict between widget-rich blogs and the tendency for people to read more and more via RSS but I still believe that the whole idea has legs.
I signed up for the beta when it was opened and got an account a few months back. I have made four serious attempts to configure a widget and have to admit that I&amp;rsquo;m flummoxed.</description>
