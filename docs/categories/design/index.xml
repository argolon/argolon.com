      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m testing out Scott Allan Wallick&amp;rsquo;s blog.txt theme. I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Sandbox and this is very impressive too. Minimalist but attractive. It is also highly configurable and has lots of hAtom and hCard goodness built-in. I prefer it to the old one we had here. Thoughts anyone?</description>

      <description>An early start to my morning had me following links and remembering great experiences. Joe Drumgoole linked over to Guy Kawasaki who linked to Bob Sutton who linked to Bill Moggridge. It started on the topic of the definition of assholes but ended up on the topic on design.
I knew the name Bob Sutton rang a bell and sure enough he was one of the lead lecturers on a week long course I did in Stanford way back in 1999.</description>
