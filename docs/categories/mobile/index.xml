      <description>You won&amp;rsquo;t regret it. Even my old clunky HTC G1 with the latest bleeding edge community firmware is now a great phone. Be sure to buy some spare batteries on eBay tho.
Well bloody done Meteor for being first to launch an Android phone in Ireland. Three seems to have dropped the ball with launches recently (possibly due to all effort going into the National Broadband scheme) and this is a real coup for one of the smaller mobile operators.</description>
