      <description>The disaster that was the information site about Cork OpenCoffee has finally been resolved. No more re-directs to Upcoming or Eventful. We now have a nice clean blog which you can subscribe to via RSS or email. We&amp;rsquo;ll keep it fully up to date with everything that is happening in OCC here.
If you have anything you want to share with the group, use any of the contacts methods listed on the site to send it through.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not often that people and technology come together so brilliantly as this morning&amp;rsquo;s Limerick OpenCoffee. I&amp;rsquo;ve just taken part in their regular session whilst sitting in a kitchen in Wexford.
Conn O Muineachain livestreamed the entire event using Ustream.tv so anyone could logon and see what was happening whilst a chat-channel allowed us to interact with the attendees. Some backchannel stuff on Twitter and Jaiku added to the mix. If that&amp;rsquo;s all they had done, then it rates as a great success.</description>

      <description>Aidan Finn just announced Galway OCC on Twitter. Upcoming.org page here. I&amp;rsquo;d been hoping for this one, I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be a big success. Looking forward to the reports. That plus BarCamp Galway are two great excuses for us to head up there.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m hitting Amsterdam at 5pm tomorrow for both the International OCC and TheNextWeb Conference. I&amp;rsquo;ll demo LouderVoice to as many people as I can and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the VC Speed Pitching session at lunchtime Friday. I&amp;rsquo;d better practice my elevator pitch tonight.
If you want to contact me from midday Thursday onwards I&amp;rsquo;ll be on +372-53-166646 (roam4free) or +353-87-9790297 (main mobile). I&amp;rsquo;ll be grabbing email on Thursday evening and probably not again until Friday night.</description>

      <description>The recent coverage of Cork OCC on national radio gave the expected boost to attendance and we had more than 15 coffee drinkers last Friday. More importantly the mix is heading in the right direction with entrepreneurs, the interested, investors, a PR guy, a corporate events guy and techies all there and all networking.
I had a ton of people I wanted to talk to and didn&amp;rsquo;t get to everyone. I did manage to have good conversations with Michael who is looking into doing local tech investments, Jan from the wonderful Touristr, Michael Tangeman from the Pen Group PR in Miami and Larry who is working on some really interesting ideas.</description>

      <description>David Lenehan has written a great overview of the Open Coffee phenomenon. Cork gets a mention. If you have any interest in building the start-up culture and community in Ireland then it is a must-read. If you like it, please Digg it too.</description>

      <description>This post should have been written over a week ago but I&amp;rsquo;m only finally getting the time now.
On Thursday 10th May, three of us from Cork Open Coffee (Walter Higgins, David Copithorne and myself) headed over to London Open Coffee. As someone who has never worked into the UK (The Netherlands and Germany being my main destinations in the past), I was pretty impressed to find myself standing outside the door of Waterstones on Regent Street at 9.</description>

      <title>Interviewed for Morning Ireland</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2007/05/17/interviewed-for-morning-ireland/</link>

      <description>I did a short interview with Emma McNamara this afternoon for Radio 1. The overall theme of her piece was &amp;ldquo;The Economy&amp;rdquo; and as with other items in the series they took a regional focus which was Cork/Munster on this occasion.
I talked for far too long about the start-up scene down here, Open Coffee, LouderVoice, PaddysValley, the Ireland=Romania state of Venture Capital here and the difficulty many have in getting access to capital.</description>

      <description>Congrats guys, I&amp;rsquo;ll be down for one soon, particularly as it&amp;rsquo;s free coffee if you visit from another OCC.
