                <p>After some hand-holding from Ivan, I got <a href="http://www.snipperoo.com/">Snipperoo</a> working on my personal blog. The basic misunderstanding I had was that I thought all the widgets shown in the help screens were pre-existing ones I could add to my panel with one click whereas in fact you have to create  each one by hand. This sounds awkward but isn&rsquo;t. Just take the normal snippet of code you would use to show that widget on your blog and paste it into a new &ldquo;module&rdquo; in Snipperoo. I did this with all my existing widgets and replaced a mess of code in my sidebar with a single Wordpress Sidebar Text Widget pointing over to Snipperoo.</p>
<p>Now any time I want to add or remove cool widgets, I wander over to Snipperoo, do the changes and they automatically appear on the blog. In this early phase you don&rsquo;t gain an enormous amount over using standard Wordpress Sidebar widgets but the potential is clear to see, particularly when all the most popular ones become one click additions.</p>
<p>Whilst the directory/gallery is confusing at the minute, at least you can see the multitude of widgets available. I could waste hours in there. I&rsquo;m looking forward to the site revamp, particularly in this area.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve only had one issue so far - the <a href="http://www.feedbutton.com/">FeedButton</a> widget seems to be not only incompatible when embedded in Snipperoo, it won&rsquo;t even co-exist in the sidebar with it. I&rsquo;ve removed it for the minute as it&rsquo;s not the most important widget around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that having a blog or public social networking page will become as ubiquitous as having a mobile phone. Not everyone will be a &ldquo;blogger&rdquo; in the current sense of the term but we&rsquo;ll all have an online identity (&ldquo;all&rdquo; meaning those with some form of broadband). Given this, we&rsquo;ll each want a custom identity, but far beyond our ringtones and crappy MySpace wallpapers. Widgets will provide a lot of that identity by pulling in and pushing out data to and from the edges and presenting the virtual you.</p>
