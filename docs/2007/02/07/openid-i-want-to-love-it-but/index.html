        <article>
            <h2 class="post-title"><a href="https://argolon.com/2007/02/07/openid-i-want-to-love-it-but/">OpenID, I want to love it but&hellip;</a></h2>

            
            
            

            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I&rsquo;ve followed a lot of the happenings with OpenID over the past nine months or so. I signed up to a few of the providers (Verisignlabs and MyOpenID) and I used it successfully to log on to Zooomr.</p>
<p>Two announcements caught my eye since yesterday. First Microsoft announced they are going to support it - well done Kim Cameron and gang. Second, the <a href="http://www.claimid.com/">ClaimID</a> guys have <a href="http://blog.claimid.com/2007/02/some-changes-at-claimid/">announced a change of direction</a> and they are going to be an OpenID provider too.</p>
<p>So, by my reckoning we have the following providers of OpenID:</p>
<ul>
<li>Verisign</li>
<li>MyOpenID</li>
<li>Typekey</li>
<li>Technorati</li>
<li>ClaimID</li>
<li>Who else?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now for the important bit - useful sites that let you login using your OpenID credentials. Emmmmmmmmmm</p>
<ul>
<li>Zooomr</li>
<li>Ma.gnolia</li>
<li>Jyte</li>
<li>LiveJournal</li>
<li>Annnnnnnnnddddddddd?</li>
</ul>
<p>Is the balance ever so slightly off here? Should the second list not be in the thousands?</p>
<p>Even worse, whilst Technorati are an OpenID provider, they won&rsquo;t let you use OpenID to log on to their site. Not only that, but as with so much of Technorati recently (and it pains me to say it as I love them), I couldn&rsquo;t use my Technorati profile to log on to Jyte (&ldquo;There was an error with the request. Please try again later.&quot;)</p>
<p>On the upside, I&rsquo;ve always been a big fan of Fred and the ClaimID guys and one of their new features is wonderful. By adding two lines to the header of my various blogs, I can now login to OpenID-enabled sites using <a href="https://www.argolon.com">https://www.argolon.com</a> or <a href="http://blog.loudervoice.com">http://blog.loudervoice.com</a>. Now I don&rsquo;t even have to remember one URL. I am the URL. Aside: This worked on Ma.gnolia and Jyte but not on Zooomr.</p>
<p>The key feature ALL OpenID-enabld sites need to support is the ability to let me login using OpenID and then let me associate an existing non-OpenID login with that identity. Ma.gnolia and Jyte both do this slickly. It doesn&rsquo;t even seem to be possible in LiveJournal, when I logged in using OpenID, it gave me a new account. And I cannot figure out if there is a way of linking a TypeKey account to an external OpenID identity. This is from the people who invented OpenID!</p>
<p>Despite all the apparent support and buzz, OpenID will remain a techie novelty until we see a huge increase in the number of sites that support it. C&rsquo;mon Yahoo, do it, do it.</p>
<p>And no more OpenID providers, enough already!</p>
