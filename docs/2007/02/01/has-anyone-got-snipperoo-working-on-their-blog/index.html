                <p>I love the idea of <a href="http://www.snipperoo.com/">Snipperoo</a> and widgets in general. There is of course the conflict between widget-rich blogs and the tendency for people to read more and more via RSS but I still believe that the whole idea has legs.</p>
<p>I signed up for the beta when it was opened and got an account a few months back. I have made four serious attempts to configure a widget and have to admit that I&rsquo;m flummoxed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve rebuilt linux kernels, compiled XEmacs on cygwin, debugged set-top boxes via RS232 but I cannot figure out how to add individual widgets to a panel.</p>
<p>Somehow something called Badgr appeared the last time I logged in and I could add that but I&rsquo;ve no idea why. I&rsquo;ve tried to follow the help page but I don&rsquo;t get the option to add widgets no matter what I do. I just keep getting sent to a directory which has links to sites and for some bizarre reason other links which try to add widgets to my Google home page. What the hell am I missing? I hope the site revamp is rolled out soon as Snipperoo has so much potential.</p>
