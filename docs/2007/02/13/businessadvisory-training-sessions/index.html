This is a fantastic idea where those with expertise in certain areas give training for free to those who are seeking it.</p>
<p>Initially it the focus is on IT/Technology but if it proves successful, I&rsquo;m sure the scope will expand. I&rsquo;m thrilled to be able to do my bit and share what little knowledge I have in a few areas on <a href="http://businessadvisory.ie/2007/02/13/share-it-cork-saturday-march-24th/">the first training day in UCC on March 24th</a>. Having worked for over 13 years in the Services and Outsourcing business and now making use of Outsourcing myself, I hope I can at least help people avoid all the mistakes I&rsquo;ve made over the years.</p>
<p>If you are in a start-up or are thinking about setting one up, I think many of the sessions will be useful to you. Head on over to <a href="http://businessadvisory.ie/2007/02/13/share-it-cork-saturday-march-24th/">BusinessAdvisory.ie</a> for all the details.</p>
