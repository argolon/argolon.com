                <p>I did a short interview with Emma McNamara this afternoon for Radio 1. The overall theme of her piece was &ldquo;The Economy&rdquo; and as with other items in the series they took a regional focus which was Cork/Munster on this occasion.</p>
<p>I talked for far too long about the start-up scene down here, <a href="http://opencoffee.ning.com/">Open Coffee</a>, <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a>, <a href="http://paddysvalley.org">PaddysValley</a>, the Ireland=Romania <a href="http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10010057.shtml">state of Venture Capital here</a> and the difficulty many have in getting access to capital. I hope I gave a balance of positives and negatives and gave some useful suggestions.</p>
<p>The segment is on at around 7.50am Friday on RTE Radio 1. It&rsquo;ll be about 4 minutes long with multiple contributors. You can also listen to the <a href="http://www.rte.ie/radio/index.html">live stream here</a>.</p>
<p>UPDATE: For those of you who didn&rsquo;t hear it, they mainly included my mentions of OCC and the need to get Academia+Talent+Money together if we want to create anything like the Silicon Valley culture.  The show was heard by about 400k people and I was told by RTE that they had plenty of calls afterwards enquiring about OCC. I think Luigi&rsquo;s at 3pm on Friday is going to be busy!</p>
