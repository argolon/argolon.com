                <p>I was emailed the other day by Paul Brennan of Ormonde Design, an old friend from way back. He told me about the sad passing of Professor Patrick Purcell of Imperial College London, who he described as a great innovator but little known Kilkenny man. I read a fine but short <a href="http://www2.ee.ic.ac.uk/inmemoriam/patrickpurcell/">obituary of him here</a> and realised that here was a man we should all have known much more about. The opening paragraph really drives this home:</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So many of us building web applications at the moment are concerned with these areas and yet Prof Purcell was decades ahead in his thinking. I&rsquo;m going to seek out some of his writings and I hope, as time progresses, he gets the recognition he deserves in this country.</p>
