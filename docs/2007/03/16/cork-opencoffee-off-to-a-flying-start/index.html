                <p>Wow that was some morning in Luigi Malone&rsquo;s! I&rsquo;d never been there before and the venue was just perfect. I arrived in to find a few of the guys along with Don the owner who stayed for the entire session.

<p>We had 20+ people turn up with the exact mix I was hoping for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start-ups like <a href="http://www.pixenate.com/">Pixenate</a>, <a href="http://www.roam4free.ie/">Roam4Free</a> and <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a></li>
<li>consultants like <a href="http://aonach.com/">Aonach</a></li>
<li>some pure techies</li>
<li>a bunch of budding entrepreneurs</li>
<li>a development advisor from Enterprise Ireland</li>
<li>Eileen from <a href="http://www.corkbic.com/html/default.htm">CorkBIC</a> (Business Innovation Centre)</li>
<li>Peter from CorkBIC <a href="https://www.businessangels.ie/">Business Angel Partnership</a></li>
<li>an industrial liaison officer from UCC</li>
<li>two ex-Motorola people</li>
<li>and several people who (rightly) came along to see what it was all about</li>
</ul>
<p>Given that it was the inaugural meeting, I said a few words, got everyone to introduce themselves and mentioned the <a href="http://businessadvisory.ie/2007/03/15/press-release-shareit-initiative-launched/">ShareIT</a> initiative, some thoughts on Coworking and a desire to get more people from the investment community involved over time.</p>
<p>Of course OpenCoffee here is being driven by the opposite group to <a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/03/second-opencoffee-club-keeps-buzzing.html">the original one in the UK</a>. Over there it is the VCs and Angels pushing it forward, over here it is the guys in start-ups. I did invite one VC but he prefers to wait and see that OpenCoffee has some legs first, which I do understand. It&rsquo;ll take time for the community to grow and for the reputation to spread. I&rsquo;d love it (or whatever it becomes) to be a place where opportunities are found, networks are built and people have a social outlet in a business context.</p>
<p>Richard (who is building something in a similar space to ourselves) made the very interesting point that his community has always been a virtual one with his peers in the US, he simply wasn&rsquo;t aware so much was happening in Cork. I hope more and more local entrepreneurs hear about us and turn up for a great cup of coffee and some start-up banter on Friday March 30th. And if you are just curious about the whole thing, head on down, we&rsquo;re a friendly bunch and we won&rsquo;t talk about Twitter too much :-)</p>
<p>Several people requested a separate info page for OpenCoffee Cork so I&rsquo;ll set something up next week and announce it here.</p>
<p>UPDATE 1: <a href="http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/03/opencoffee-keeps-growing.html">Saul has a list</a> of all the recent OpenCoffee Clubs around the world. Damned impressive!</p>
