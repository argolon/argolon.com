                <p>A little storm erupted this morning over the TechLudd initiative which was launched by some of those who went on the Paddy’s Valley trip to the USA. Paul Walsh from Segala <a href="http://segala.com/blog/why-techludd-should-stop-before-it-starts">considers it misguided</a> and wonders why no attempt was made to reach out to existing networks in Ireland, particularly considering TechLudd is supposed to be about networking. I offered my few cents in support of Paul’s position and some decent debate ensued in the comments.</p>
<p>Fergus Burns posted a comment which I consider incredibly important to the web community and I quote it below. I encourage you to offer your own opinions on the Segala post.</p>
<p>On a sidenote, I just did a theme change on the <a href="http://web2ireland.org/">Web2Ireland</a> site and imported all my old blognation posts there. It would be fantastic if some designer in the Irish web community would do a custom design and logo for the site. It has a large number of RSS subscribers and many highly influential people visit it regularly. It would be a great calling card for your design abilities.</p>
<p>Fergus on Web2Ireland and the community here:</p>

<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Web2Ireland is for everyone - its not me, nooked - its about the community</li>
<li>it was setup @ web2con in SF in 2005</li>
<li>its audience is widespread - you would be surprised who’s subscribed</li>
<li>web2ireland is a brand that people relate to [esp. outside of Ireland]</li>
<li>EI provide no support to the forum - although its all about startups/web companies in Ireland [32 counties]</li>
<li>I personally pay for the domain reg.</li>
<li>Hosting365 provide hosting for free</li>
<li>we ran one large conf in 2006 - which EI stage managed</li>
<li>Web2Ireland only works because people like Conor, Paul, Sean, Jonathan, Julian and a host of others contribute</li>
<li>we also try to stimulate activity - seedcamp, opencoffee, barcamp, etc - not in the business of “approving stuff”</li>
<li>we tried our best to get EI to do a israelwebtour - instead people stepped up and PV happened</li>
<li>Demobar was based on Stirr model in Valley</li>
<li>Ryan/FOWA presented a great opp to make the 1st event successful</li>
<li>Sean O’Sullivan made DemoBar I happen</li>
<li>the next demobar was pencilled in for end of Jan [the date was based on a keynote speaker availability and working with Ireland Inc dinner, etc - hence how Paul and I ended up talking about events in Jan]</li>
<li>We have sponsors already - instead of us going with a begging bowl, we actually have people coming to us. [and some of these sponsors contacted me in relation to techludd - confusion as you can imagine]</li>
<li>At the end of the day the question is - do you want a vibrant community @ web2 in Ireland or do you want a host of little groups doing their own thing.</li>
<li>An example of how it can work from <a href="http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/2007/09/18/dublin-paris-and-amsterdam">Ryan Carson</a>: “The scene in Dublin is very, very exciting. So much so that I’d venture to say that it’s even more happening than the London scene. We had a massive turnout (200 excited people), there were demos, tons of networking - it felt even more exciting than a TechCrunch party in Silicon Valley. I’d say a big key to that is the Web2Ireland group. They’re very positive, outgoing and excited about succeeding in the web space.”</li>
<li>An example of it not working was MashupCamp - that was not good - Damien posted what everybody felt was wrong.</li>
<li>In summary its all about a successful ecosystem - we’re struggling to create one - and I question if we’ll ever have one.</li>
<li>Its not about who does what - its about who does what for everyone - and creating success for a everyone</li>
</ul>
