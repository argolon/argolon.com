<p>We are currently using a full outsource model for both the development and design of <a href="http://www.loudervoice.com/">LouderVoice</a>. We are aiming to change this to a hybrid inhouse/outsource approach as we get closer to full launch.</p>
<p>To that end we are looking to hire a full-time experienced web developer. If you have a strong background in end-to-end web development and <strong>you are looking for all the opportunities that being the lead developer in a start-up provides</strong> then we want to hear from you. Ideally you will be based in Cork but in fact we&rsquo;re open to talking to developers around the country. Some of the things we are looking for include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience as lead developer of MVC-style web applications</li>
<li>Strong background in agile languages, particularly Python</li>
<li>Deep knowledge of web frameworks such as TurboGears (which we use), Django, Pylons, Rails, Code Igniter or similar</li>
<li>Successful history of working with offshore and distributed development and design teams</li>
<li>Expertise in creating high-performance scalable application architectures using MySQL</li>
<li>ATOM/RSS</li>
<li>Commitment to XHTML/CSS/Semantic Markup</li>
<li>Ajax UIs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a permanent position based in Ireland and the salary/benefits package will be commensurate with experience.</p>
