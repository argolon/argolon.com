            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I recently had a great meeting with Paul Healy of the Rubicon Incubation Centre in CIT in Cork. This has been a runaway success since it opened a year ago and I wanted to find out more. The Centre is probably best know for the <a href="http://www.gep.ie/showcase/index.html">Genesis Enterprise Programme</a> but actually offers a lot more than this.</p>
<p>The Centre has not had a lot of marketing around it and I wondered why. The reason is simple; they have been full from almost the very start! Slots only appear when start-ups move on or when those taking part in GEP complete their stint. As a result, they are opening a new building on Model Farm Road right now and are just about to start an extension to the current building.</p>
<p>Here are some of the Rubicon stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently 80 seat - full</li>
<li>20 of those are for Genesis</li>
<li>They run the Enterprise Start program for those considering the jump (Ã¢â€šÂ¬275)</li>
<li>Recently ran a special one for ex-Motorola people - strong interest</li>
<li>Rubicon is self-financing, and gets no money from CIT</li>
<li>They have to balance their books</li>
</ul>
<p>The way the current building is setup for GEP gives it some of the attributes of a co-working space. Multiple start-ups share a room with no partitions etc. I&rsquo;ve already seen how this is a big enabler for networking as Walter from Pixenate has put me in contact with people in there with similar interests.</p>
<p>The new building on Model Farm Road sounds like an ideal co-working space and Paul is very interested in facilitating that. The basic stats are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building is 20,000 sq feet</li>
<li>80 seats</li>
<li>It also has lab space due to chronic shortage of this in the region</li>
<li>10x Hot Desks initially with more coming</li>
<li>5x already gone</li>
<li>Ã¢â€šÂ¬220 per month</li>
<li>Rolling one month agreement with same desk for each month</li>
<li>Phone , 10MB broadband, Wifi</li>
<li>Secure server room</li>
</ul>
<p>It really does sound like a perfect setup and the location means you avoid the worst of City Centre traffic whilst being quite close to the centre. The price is fantastic! I think I can see us using this over the summer.</p>
<p>I also gave Kay Wright in <a href="http://www.webworkscork.com/">Webworks</a> a call as I had been told they do hot-desking too. The Webworks building is slap bang in the City Centre and provided an awesome venue for the first BarCamp Ireland. The whole layout was created to encourage &ldquo;water cooler conversations&rdquo; and has lots of breakout areas. It&rsquo;s biggest flaw remains the price. I really don&rsquo;t think it can be called an incubation centre given that it charges full-ticket city-centre rates for the standard offices. Hopefully this will change given that the building remains almost totally unused apart from Cubic and one or two others.</p>
<p>The Webworks hot-desking stats are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ã¢â€šÂ¬125 per week plus VAT</li>
<li>Wifi. Broadband (2MB symmetrical I think)</li>
<li>Phone on desk. Pay for line rental and calls</li>
<li>14 desks. 6 in one room, 8 in other</li>
<li>Coffee Dock with burka boiler</li>
<li>Underground car-park, not sure if spaces cost</li>
</ul>
<p>If I can suggest one thing to both locations - instant coffee doesn&rsquo;t cut it any more! One of those wee on-demand latte/espresso machines, whilst not perfect, is a huge leap forward from Maxwell House :-) Maybe even one of those <a href="http://www.singleservecoffee.com/archives/002733.php">single serve pod systems</a>.</p>
<p>I should also mention the great sounding building out in <a href="http://www.macroom-e.com/services.htm">The Macroom Environmental Industrial Park</a> which served as the inspiration for the Rubicon hot-desking. I know Walter was highly impressed when he checked it out.</p>
