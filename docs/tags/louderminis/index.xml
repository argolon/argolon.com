      <description>When one of the most famous web design gurus on the planet, whose books we adore, says he likes something you&amp;rsquo;ve built, well it&amp;rsquo;s a damned nice feeling indeed.
So Dan Cederholm likes LouderTweets.

We&amp;rsquo;ve been getting LouderTweets from as far away as Japan and The Philippines. Keep them coming.
Just to give a sense of the variety of those mini-reviews, some of the most recent were:

      <description>We announced LouderTweets recently, which are 140 character mini-reviews you can send to LouderVoice from Twitter without needing a LouderVoice account.
Last night we turned on LouderViesti which is the equivalent feature for the superb Jaiku. Jaiku is like Twitter but can do much much more. They are based in Finland and are adding great features at a fast rate.
We are now calling LouderTweets+LouderViesti = LouderMinis!
Using LouderViesti is even easier than LouderTweets.</description>
