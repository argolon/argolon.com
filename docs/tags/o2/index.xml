      <description>I got an unlocked HTC G1 from the US recently for a project we are working on. This is the first Google Android phone and I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a full review soon. The first thing you have to do is activate the phone with Google and I immediately ran into problems. It turns out you need to add the Irish mobile network Access Points to the phone so it knows how to connect to the internet.</description>

      <description>Is there any other phrase to describe the mobile operators? From Vodafone&amp;rsquo;s rip-off hamstrung data plans to the O2&amp;rsquo;s Paddy Tax on the iPhone, they&amp;rsquo;d take money from a baby to keep their unsustainable ARPUs up. &amp;ldquo;Hey Baby Phones! No-one has done baby phones. That&amp;rsquo;s an untapped demographic. We could coat the phones in sugar.&amp;rdquo;
Supposedly these operators know our business and their own. I guess that explains iMode. But perhaps they are getting a clue?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking recently about Nokia and my general feeling is that they are missing many simple opportunities to retain leadership in mobile development.
Apart from one crappy Panasonic and a dog-slow Sony-Ericcson T610, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Nokia phones. They have been solid workhorses with just the right combination of features for me. Until last year, that meant Series 40 phones but I then finally succumbed and bought an N70 a year ago.</description>
