      <description>There have been many blog postings over the past two weeks making technology predictions for 2006 and beyond. Bill Burnham has taken a look back at 2005 and sees that the software industry itself has been shrinking. Last year, the aggregate market capitalization of the software sector shank by almost 10%.
From this he makes some very interesting predictions which are very close to what we have been hearing anecdotally and which are supported by many of the moves in the enterprise space in recent times.</description>

      <description>Business Objects have announced that they are joining the Eclipse Foundation and are going to Open Source some of their tools. This is a very timely move for them as there appears to be a lot of energy building behind their Open Source competitors which must surely be hurting sales of Crystal at the low-end.
Whilst none of the Open Source tools have the breadth and depth of Crystal&amp;rsquo;s capabilities, in many cases they are &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;.</description>
