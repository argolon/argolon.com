      <description>Last Wednesday we quietly unveiled LouderVoice. If you want a reviews site which takes a fundamentally different approach to everyone else then you&amp;rsquo;ll like what we have built.
Bloggers who write reviews now have a site which is built around enabling them to publish reviews to blogs in a widely accepted format. Everyone else now has a site where they can find great reviews, read them on those blogs and then rate them, share them and subscribe to more.</description>
