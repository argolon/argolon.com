      <description>James Corbett is building a map of Wifi Hotspots around the country. Whilst they can be free or non-free, I hope we can identify as many free ones as possible first. I&amp;rsquo;ve added the ones I know of in Cork and indicated whether they are publicly accessible locations or not.

If you know of any, please spread the love and add a push-pin to the map. You should also include any FON hotspots that you know of.</description>
