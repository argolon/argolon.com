      <description>There has been some new buzz about Movable Type since version 4 was released a while back. I had carried out one install of v3 previously to ensure that we supported it ok in LouderVoice. It was one of the worst install experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to build XEmacs from source on Windows. V3 made me realise why Wordpress had left MT eating its dust. The WP boast of a 5 minute install was not an empty one and it &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; out of the box in most cases.</description>
