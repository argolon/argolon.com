      <description>Cross-posted from Web2Ireland:
Damien Mulley gets community like very few other people in the industry. His ideas are always worth listening to and, more importantly, worth acting on. He has just kicked off a real corker called The Tuesday Push. Every second Tuesday, a startup is selected from those who put themselves forward and lots of us blog about them on the same day.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of those simple but potentially incredibly powerful ways of getting us all noticed.</description>

Rating: 5 out of 5
Tom, Catherine and all the team at IT@Cork put on a fantastic half day Web 2.0 conference on Thursday.
The geek dinner the night before set the scene perfectly - thanks again to Damien and all the organisers of that and Stormhoek for the wine. I finally got to meet Damien, Donncha, Gavin and a few others who I had previously only known through their blogs like Branedy and his lovely wife.</description>
