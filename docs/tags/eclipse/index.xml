      <description>In our first Python post we mentioned that there can be push-back on the usage of Python in solutions for customers, particularly if the entire system is to be built in Python.
An interesting alternative which can gain more customer acceptance is Jython. This is Python reimplemented in Java and it provides features which are compelling both from a technical perspective and customer acceptance perspective. To the customer, Jython can be viewed as simply another part of a Java based solution where it is providing some scripting, automation and high-level glue.</description>

      <description>Business Objects have announced that they are joining the Eclipse Foundation and are going to Open Source some of their tools. This is a very timely move for them as there appears to be a lot of energy building behind their Open Source competitors which must surely be hurting sales of Crystal at the low-end.
Whilst none of the Open Source tools have the breadth and depth of Crystal&amp;rsquo;s capabilities, in many cases they are &amp;ldquo;good enough&amp;rdquo;.</description>
