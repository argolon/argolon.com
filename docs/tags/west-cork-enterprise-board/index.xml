      <description>I spent a very interesting afternoon talking to Christine O&amp;rsquo;Donovan in WCEB in Clonakilty on Tuesday. We covered a pretty wide range of topics and I was highly impressed by the range of services they offer local businesses.

Our big area of mutual frustration was the lack of take-up on the Tech-Check scheme. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it before on my personal blog and in summary, if you are a local biz in Ireland with even one laptop and you&amp;rsquo;ve never even talked to an Enterprise Board, then you are missing out hugely.</description>

      <description>West Cork Enterprise Board contacted me last week to let me know about a discount offer they had received from the IIA for their client companies (and those of all CEBs). There was a further discount offered for being outside of Dublin too. Whilst the original price of €345 for non-members was just a bit at the high end for us, the double-discounted price of less than €150 is a bargain and I&amp;rsquo;ve signed up to attend.</description>
