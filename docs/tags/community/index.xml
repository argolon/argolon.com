      <description>Cross-posted from Web2Ireland:
Damien Mulley gets community like very few other people in the industry. His ideas are always worth listening to and, more importantly, worth acting on. He has just kicked off a real corker called The Tuesday Push. Every second Tuesday, a startup is selected from those who put themselves forward and lots of us blog about them on the same day.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of those simple but potentially incredibly powerful ways of getting us all noticed.</description>

      <description>A little storm erupted this morning over the TechLudd initiative which was launched by some of those who went on the Paddy’s Valley trip to the USA. Paul Walsh from Segala considers it misguided and wonders why no attempt was made to reach out to existing networks in Ireland, particularly considering TechLudd is supposed to be about networking. I offered my few cents in support of Paul’s position and some decent debate ensued in the comments.</description>

      <description>Aidan Finn just announced Galway OCC on Twitter. Upcoming.org page here. I&amp;rsquo;d been hoping for this one, I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be a big success. Looking forward to the reports. That plus BarCamp Galway are two great excuses for us to head up there.</description>

      <description>David Lenehan has written a great overview of the Open Coffee phenomenon. Cork gets a mention. If you have any interest in building the start-up culture and community in Ireland then it is a must-read. If you like it, please Digg it too.</description>

      <description>This post should have been written over a week ago but I&amp;rsquo;m only finally getting the time now.
On Thursday 10th May, three of us from Cork Open Coffee (Walter Higgins, David Copithorne and myself) headed over to London Open Coffee. As someone who has never worked into the UK (The Netherlands and Germany being my main destinations in the past), I was pretty impressed to find myself standing outside the door of Waterstones on Regent Street at 9.</description>

      <description>Congrats guys, I&amp;rsquo;ll be down for one soon, particularly as it&amp;rsquo;s free coffee if you visit from another OCC.

      <description>We had another good turnout this morning at Open Coffee and covered a lot of ground from technology companies not building good links with content companies to quite a long discussion about aims and metrics associated with Cork Open Coffee.
Haydn made some strong points about the fact that many web businesses are very heavily involved in content (the classic User Generated Content) but they seem to focus on business networking in a technology realm.</description>

      <title>Second Cork Open Coffee building the mix</title>

      <description>We had the second Cork Open Coffee meet-up last Friday. As expected the numbers were down slightly but I was thrilled to see that over half the faces were new and we had some great additions to the attendee profile.
I had hoped when we kicked off OpenCoffee here that it would not just be about web people doing web stuff but would reach out to other technology business areas. So I was delighted to say hi to someone working in telecoms, to a developer from the Bay area (no not Bantry Bay) and to two people, new to the region, who work in multimedia and video production.</description>

      <description>Head on down to Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s any time between 10 and 12 and there should be some of us there talking tech and business and maybe a little Heroes. Particularly interested in talking to people about Coworking possibilities today.</description>

      <title>Open Coffee Club Ning Page</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2007/03/22/open-coffee-club-ning-page/</link>

      <description>Saul and the guys have setup a Ning page for Open Coffee. Ning is basically a social networking app. On the page you can see members, recent blog posts tagged with opencoffee, ditto pictures and more importantly Upcoming.org events that are tagged. It is one central place to find out what is happening in OpenCoffee globally.
On a more local level, as part of that, I have created an Upcoming.org group called (funnily enough) The Cork Open Coffee Club.</description>
