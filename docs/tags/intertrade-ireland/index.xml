      <description>I was disappointed to see that no Irish start-ups made it through to the initial 20 on SeedCamp. My gut tells me this is simply due to lack of applications. I only knew of one start-up here that applied. Did you? As the old ad goes &amp;ldquo;if you&amp;rsquo;re not in, you can&amp;rsquo;t win&amp;rdquo;.
Maybe when they see the great outcome for the winners of the first one, we&amp;rsquo;ll have more youngfellas and youngwans getting up of their bums and giving it a go.</description>
