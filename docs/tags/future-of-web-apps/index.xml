      <description>The good people of Carson Systems have made the recordings and presentations of the various speakers from FoWA London 2007 available for download. Even though I was there I&amp;rsquo;ve grabbed a bunch of them to listen to and read again as there are some real gems. If only other conference organisers were so generous!</description>

      <description>Back at base now and didn&amp;rsquo;t get a chance yesterday to write about some of the other speakers. Overall Day 1 was more impressive than Day 2. The Open Mic slot was poor overall but Phil&amp;rsquo;s presentation was very entertaining. It was a pity he had so little time as I&amp;rsquo;m sure a Q&amp;amp;A; afterwards would have been very heated!
However we did have another highlight near the end with the guys from MOO.</description>
