      <description>The new Programme for Government has been announced by the coalition in Ireland and one of the most important aspects of it is the announcement of the position of CIO. Whilst you might think this is only of interest to those who work in technology, I think it has the potential to be a critical role in preparing the country for renewal.
I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to seeing a CIO with real teeth and real vision who understands that information is power and power should be given to as many people as possible.</description>

      <description>Whilst I&amp;rsquo;ve had a lot of conversations with other start-ups about how the Government can help entrepreneurs more, I&amp;rsquo;ve also had a few with those who think it should do less.
One of those, an ex-pat Irish Angel, whose thoughts we hope to be able to share with a wider audience in the coming weeks, sent me this link to an article in The Economist.
The Fading Lustre of Clusters.</description>
