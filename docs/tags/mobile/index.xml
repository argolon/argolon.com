      <description>The 2008 predictions weren&amp;rsquo;t the most accurate. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how we do for 2009.
 The Android platform will be absolutely huge. With Motorola, Sony Ericsson and a raft of Tier 2 manufacturers signed up, it will become _the _mobile platform from the mid to high end. Ignore the HTC G1, that&amp;rsquo;s just a rough first attempt by one manufacturer.Â  Despite Android, iPhone will remain big. There is always that 10% of the market who like paying extra for &amp;ldquo;luxury&amp;rdquo; brands SaaS ecommerce providers will go mainstream.</description>

      <title>Vodafone - Staring into the Abyss</title>

      <description>I have come to the conclusion that Vodafone will be roadkill on the path to ubiquitous connectivity. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to several mobile operators in the past year and they all accept that they must become internet companies, they just don&amp;rsquo;t know how. This indecision will be fatal if Google decides to go global with Android and their spectrum purchases. Given my experiences as a simple punter in the past two weeks, can I beseech Google to buy the Three network off Hutchison Whampoa and show this relic of the 20th century what execution is all about?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m still buzzing over the fact that the blognation Ireland site has gone live. We&amp;rsquo;ve already made it to the front page of Techmeme!
As I said in the opening post:
The Irish site is part of the blognation network which is building up to be the biggest tech news site on non-US Web 2.0 startups around the globe including EMEA, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada
Feel free to send me any news about your web or mobile application, no matter how early stage you are.</description>
