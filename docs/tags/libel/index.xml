      <description>Mike Butcher has just published a very useful piece on how to protect yourself as a blogger if you write something that results in a libel action being mounted against you and your content. It is all based around &amp;ldquo;The Reynolds defense of Responsible Journalism&amp;rdquo;. Whilst it makes total sense to me as a lay-person, it clearly is only directly relevant to UK bloggers.
Since it&amp;rsquo;s generally felt that Irish libel law is even more ridiculous than that of the UK, I wonder if there are any similar cases/precedents that apply here?</description>
