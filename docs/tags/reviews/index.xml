      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy few weeks.
 Two years after LouderVoice launched with the aim to make reviews more useful via Microformats, Google announced support, followed quickly by several of our competitors. What took ye so long? Then we launched Ireland&amp;rsquo;s first Google Android Mobile application Then we enabled the use of simple #review to identify mini-reviews on Twitter Then Krishna De of Biz Growth Newsreleased an extended interview with CEO Conor all about ratings and reviews.</description>

      <description>We went live on Puddleducks.ie a few weeks back and the response has been fantastic.
Today we went live with Bubble Brothers wine in Cork. They are the first users of our new SME customer reviews solution. This is a widget which can be dropped on a product page with one line of code and review-enables the entire site. No development is needed by the client and our simple job is to add the correct styling elements so that the widget blends with your site.</description>

      <title>Touristr Beta Seriously Impressive</title>

      <description>Jan Blanchard has been building a great travel site called Touristr for quite a while. I did some beta testing for him a while back and the potential was obvious. With their latest open beta, they&amp;rsquo;ve really improved the look and navigation of the site.
In their own words:
I think they have a winner on their hands.
