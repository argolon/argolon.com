      <description>The it@cork annual conference has just been announced. Its title is &amp;ldquo;GREEN IT: Reduce CO2, Raise Profits&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s on November 26 in the lovely Radisson SAS Hotel in Cork.
The line-up looks like an excellent mix with the focus being clearly on Green as it relates to IT and Business. I particularly like the profit angle given the turmoil the world is going through right now
The is an Early Bird Discount available – Book on or before October 31 and it&amp;rsquo;s €250 for members, €350 for non members.</description>

      <description>PodCamp last year was one of my conference highlights and it looks like they are pulling out all the stops this year.
Head on down to Kilkenny this coming Saturday if you want to see what it&amp;rsquo;s all about. Tons of information and pre-conference activity on the PodCamp Ireland site.</description>
