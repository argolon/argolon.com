      <description>I watched with great dismay this week as PeopleAggregator launched and created a swirl of negative comment due to the slightly spammy nature of Marc Canter&amp;rsquo;s invites to anyone who had ever mailed him. I have huge respect for Marc and his vision, passion, directness and energy but he really made a pigs ear of the launch. Instead of everyone discussing all of the possibilities created by PeepAg, the buzz just fizzled almost immediately.</description>
