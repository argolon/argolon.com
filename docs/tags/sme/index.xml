      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just been talking to a small local business that uses Apple Macs exclusively for all their computing needs. The owners expressed frustration over the lack of support they receive from state agencies in areas like training etc. In fact, they said that grants were offered at one stage to help small biz buy PCs but Macs were excluded!
These people almost felt like they were the only small biz using Macs in all of Cork.</description>
