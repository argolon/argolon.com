      <description>As anyone who has kicked off a BES scheme knows there are a few simple steps you have to do in order to qualify. The key one is a &amp;ldquo;New Company Cert&amp;rdquo; from Enterprise Ireland or a CEB. To qualify for the cert they generally give you a small employment grant (a Feasibility Study Grant is not sufficient). You can then go to the Revenue and start the actual BES process itself and get in-principal approval for your scheme.</description>
