      <description>The 2008 predictions weren&amp;rsquo;t the most accurate. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how we do for 2009.
 The Android platform will be absolutely huge. With Motorola, Sony Ericsson and a raft of Tier 2 manufacturers signed up, it will become _the _mobile platform from the mid to high end. Ignore the HTC G1, that&amp;rsquo;s just a rough first attempt by one manufacturer.Â  Despite Android, iPhone will remain big. There is always that 10% of the market who like paying extra for &amp;ldquo;luxury&amp;rdquo; brands SaaS ecommerce providers will go mainstream.</description>

      <title>A great addition to UseAMap</title>

      <description>Vinny Glennon has a genuinely useful site in UseAMap. Starting from the simple idea of doing a &amp;ldquo;TinyURL for Maps&amp;rdquo;, Vinny has built one of my favourite mapping apps.
The most recent addition is a huge boon to those of us who live in The Google Maps Darklands - UseAMap is now integrated with Yahoo Maps too.
Both Yahoo and Microsoft do a far superior job of mapping West Cork than Google.</description>

      <description>We intend to outsource the bulk of the development of our application. This will be broken down into several areas including:
 Design XHTML/CSS Application development Hosting Operations  I have received plenty of recommendations for Design and some for XHTML/CSS but other than Ryan Carson recommending Nick in Plum Digital Media (and more on yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;How to build a WebApp&amp;rdquo; workshop later), it is proving difficult to get recommendations for top-class web application development houses.</description>
