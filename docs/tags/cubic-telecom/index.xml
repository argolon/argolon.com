      <description>Brian Cowen got it all wrong in the December budget. Exchequer receipts were not down in 2007 due to the property market collapse, it&amp;rsquo;s because we were all on Twitter.
Pat Phelan and Florian Seroussi have calculated a $13.5B hit to the global economy due to Twitter usage reducing productivity in 2007. Using the Runge Kutta Algorithm adjusted by the gAb factor, that&amp;rsquo;s a â‚¬4B hit on the Irish economy!</description>

      <description>Cross-posting from the LouderVoice Blog:
We are incredibly excited that an opportunity to attend TechCrunch40 in San Francisco next week has appeared. It is all due to the wonderful Pat Phelan of Cubic Telecom who offered a free ticket to a well deserving start-up. LouderVoice is that start-up and I&amp;rsquo;ll be there from Sunday until Wednesday afternoon.
If you are in the Bay area and would like to meet up and talk business and technology or you are from the investment community, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see you whilst I am there.</description>
