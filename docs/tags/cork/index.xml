      <description>The SBP has an excellent supplement about Cork in today&amp;rsquo;s edition. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll make it onto their web-site at some stage. Caroline Allen dedicated the entire back page to start-ups and include quotes from CorkBIC, Rubicon Centre, it@cork and Argolon/LouderVoice. The full piece is well worth a read, particularly considering the same message was coming loud and clear from us all. Hopefully someone in Government will read it and get that message!</description>

      <title>A possible web solution for small/micro biz</title>

      <description>We had a great exchange of ideas on the previous post about ways of getting very small businesses online. Of particular interest to me are the companies with zero technical ability who just need a solution which involves them typing in some information about their company and then they have a web-presence.
One solution for this type of business is eWrite &amp;ldquo;Cork&amp;rdquo;. Up until now the eWrite guys, John and Gordon, have been focused more on the Small to Medium end of the market rather than the Micro to Small.</description>

      <description>This is such a great idea.

There are 4 categories:
 1. Emerging Company Award - to recognise a leading company in early stage business planning and execution 2. High Potential Award - to recognise a leading established company driving forward in international markets 3.</description>

      <description>This post should have been written over a week ago but I&amp;rsquo;m only finally getting the time now.
On Thursday 10th May, three of us from Cork Open Coffee (Walter Higgins, David Copithorne and myself) headed over to London Open Coffee. As someone who has never worked into the UK (The Netherlands and Germany being my main destinations in the past), I was pretty impressed to find myself standing outside the door of Waterstones on Regent Street at 9.</description>

      <description>I did a short interview with Emma McNamara this afternoon for Radio 1. The overall theme of her piece was &amp;ldquo;The Economy&amp;rdquo; and as with other items in the series they took a regional focus which was Cork/Munster on this occasion.
I talked for far too long about the start-up scene down here, Open Coffee, LouderVoice, PaddysValley, the Ireland=Romania state of Venture Capital here and the difficulty many have in getting access to capital.</description>

      <description>We had another good turnout this morning at Open Coffee and covered a lot of ground from technology companies not building good links with content companies to quite a long discussion about aims and metrics associated with Cork Open Coffee.
Haydn made some strong points about the fact that many web businesses are very heavily involved in content (the classic User Generated Content) but they seem to focus on business networking in a technology realm.</description>

      <title>Second Cork Open Coffee building the mix</title>

      <description>We had the second Cork Open Coffee meet-up last Friday. As expected the numbers were down slightly but I was thrilled to see that over half the faces were new and we had some great additions to the attendee profile.
I had hoped when we kicked off OpenCoffee here that it would not just be about web people doing web stuff but would reach out to other technology business areas. So I was delighted to say hi to someone working in telecoms, to a developer from the Bay area (no not Bantry Bay) and to two people, new to the region, who work in multimedia and video production.</description>
