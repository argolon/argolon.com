      <description>This is such a great idea.
On November 1, 2007 it@cork will have their first ever Leaderâ€™s Awards. They want to recognise some of the leading companies and individuals in the community and have an evening of networking, reflection and celebration.
There are 4 categories:
 1. Emerging Company Award - to recognise a leading company in early stage business planning and execution 2. High Potential Award - to recognise a leading established company driving forward in international markets 3.</description>

      <description>We have a deep rooted problem in Ireland with getting young people to take part in the start-up culture. Every kid who leaves college with a degree in engineering/computing/business in the US wants to build something great. Every kid who leaves college in Ireland with a degree in engineering/computing/business wants a nice job in a bank or multi-national. This has to change.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been interviewing people for many years in all my different jobs.</description>
