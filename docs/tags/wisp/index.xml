      <description>Evert over at AirAppz is doing some research into the landing pages you see when you login to HotspotsÂ and other access points over Wifi. In my experience they vary from unusable (Charles De Gaulle Airport) to very friendly (all FON ones).
What Evert would like you to do is screengrab any you encounter (PrintScreen button on your keyboard) and send them to him at captures@airappz.com
I know he has some very interesting plans in that space so all the help you can give would be appreciated.</description>
