      <description>We were chuffed to bits and tickled pink this morning to see that David Lenehan has done an article about Irish webapps on the very highly regarded Read/WriteWeb site and we got a mention!
Thanks guys.
He also profiled some of the older guys like Pigsback and newer ones like Pixenate, Putplace and Nooked and not forgetting PollDaddy itself.
If you liked what David had to say, maybe consider voting for it over at Digg?</description>
