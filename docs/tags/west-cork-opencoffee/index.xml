      <description>I founded Cork OpenCoffee back in early 2007 and I&amp;rsquo;m delighted to see it grow to be the most successful OCC in Ireland. The bulk of the organising is now done by Gordon Murray of Murrion Software and Ciara Crossan of Weddingdates.
A few months back OpenCoffee Mallow launched and by all accounts is going really well. Their next meet-up is in Springfort Hall, on Tuesday the 6th of October, from 10 am until approx 12Â pm.</description>
