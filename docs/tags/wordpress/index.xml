      <description>There has been some new buzz about Movable Type since version 4 was released a while back. I had carried out one install of v3 previously to ensure that we supported it ok in LouderVoice. It was one of the worst install experiences I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to build XEmacs from source on Windows. V3 made me realise why Wordpress had left MT eating its dust. The WP boast of a 5 minute install was not an empty one and it &amp;ldquo;just works&amp;rdquo; out of the box in most cases.</description>

      <description>Please please please stop changing what I write.
You don&amp;rsquo;t know best. I do!
If I enter three dots, I want three dots, not a bloody ellipsis.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want smart quotes.
Don&amp;rsquo;t replace my apostrophes with backticks.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want my perfectly valid nested XHTML trashed when you &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; it.
If I enter a div in the Rich Text Editor, I want a div, not a damned p.
I swear, this behaviour reminds me most of Microsoft Word.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m testing out Scott Allan Wallick&amp;rsquo;s blog.txt theme. I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Sandbox and this is very impressive too. Minimalist but attractive. It is also highly configurable and has lots of hAtom and hCard goodness built-in. I prefer it to the old one we had here. Thoughts anyone?</description>

The Q&amp;amp;A; session didn&amp;rsquo;t last very long but did throw up some interesting points.
To kick off, there were various tech questions for Rob. Then Fergus was asked how long it took to launch Nooked, He replied that it was about a year after 3 different models. Walter was asked how he was hiring. He isn&amp;rsquo;t. There was a question about to get the right right developer expertise.</description>
