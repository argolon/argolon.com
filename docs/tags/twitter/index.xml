      <description>Brian Cowen got it all wrong in the December budget. Exchequer receipts were not down in 2007 due to the property market collapse, it&amp;rsquo;s because we were all on Twitter.
Pat Phelan and Florian Seroussi have calculated a $13.5B hit to the global economy due to Twitter usage reducing productivity in 2007. Using the Runge Kutta Algorithm adjusted by the gAb factor, that&amp;rsquo;s a â‚¬4B hit on the Irish economy!</description>

      <description>After a few late nights we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to let you send reviews from Twitter to LouderVoice. We&amp;rsquo;re calling them LouderTweets and they are 140 character mini-reviews you can send using Web, SMS or IM via Twitter to LouderVoice.
An important point is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a LouderVoice member to send LouderTweets but you should join if you want to rate, bookmark and build/share useful collections of reviews and mini-reviews.</description>

      <description>James over at Eirepreneur has very neatly brought together the idea of Coworking with Twitter. He has taken the Twitter feeds of a set of Irish developers and freelancers that he knows and spliced them into Grazr. It provides a single combined feed of a set of people who are all in Ireland, work in similar areas and know each other to some degree.
It gives that extra bit of socialisation that freelancers need.</description>
