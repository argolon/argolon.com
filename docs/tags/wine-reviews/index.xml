      <description>We went live on Puddleducks.ie a few weeks back and the response has been fantastic.
Today we went live with Bubble Brothers wine in Cork. They are the first users of our new SME customer reviews solution. This is a widget which can be dropped on a product page with one line of code and review-enables the entire site. No development is needed by the client and our simple job is to add the correct styling elements so that the widget blends with your site.</description>
