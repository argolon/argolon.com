      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to see that the YouGetItBack guys have launched the Beta versions of Laptop Superhero andÂ Mobile Superhero (love the branding!). These are applications you install and are activated when your device is lost or stolen. For the well-intentioned finder, the app tells them how to contact YGIB so that they can return the device to you. For the badly-intentioned finder, it locks the devices down so they cannot be used.</description>

      <description>Just spotted that the YouGetItBack guys in Cork nowhave a blog. It&amp;rsquo;s all about the business of Lost and Found and whilst they only started on Monday, the posts are flying in.
I wrote about them on my personal blog wayyy back in June 2006 when I found out about their initial product/service. It was a great idea then and it still is now. Buy a sticker for your phone/iPod etc, register the sticker code, put sticker on item.</description>
