      <description>Jaiku Invites is a great initiative from Ciarán Rooney. When Google bought Jaiku they shut down new user registrations. There are a lot of people out there who would love to join and take part in all the great discussions we have there, particularly around events like OpenCoffee and BarCamps. Luckily each existing member was given 10 invites that they could hand out.
The purpose of Jaiku Invites is to hook these two groups of people together.</description>
