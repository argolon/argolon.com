      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not often that people and technology come together so brilliantly as this morning&amp;rsquo;s Limerick OpenCoffee. I&amp;rsquo;ve just taken part in their regular session whilst sitting in a kitchen in Wexford.
Conn O Muineachain livestreamed the entire event using Ustream.tv so anyone could logon and see what was happening whilst a chat-channel allowed us to interact with the attendees. Some backchannel stuff on Twitter and Jaiku added to the mix. If that&amp;rsquo;s all they had done, then it rates as a great success.</description>
