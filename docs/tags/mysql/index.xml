      <description>The Inquirer has a nice round-up of most of the players in the Open Source Datbase Market. Over the past few years, we have dealt with a lot of different customer DBs and here are a few thoughts based on that experience.
Overall what we have seen is an inexorable move from Oracle to SQL Server at the high end and a move from commercial DBs to Open Source ones at the low and mid-end.</description>

      <description>As mentioned in a previous post, we have been having great success recently using Python as a develoment language for both customer engagements and our own internal long-term projects. There are however, some areas where we have to make decisions in its usage.
The first is quite simple - development environment. The options are currently quite limited: The PythonWin IDE, Eclipse with PyDev or &amp;ldquo;Insert Name of One True Editor Here&amp;rdquo;+ CLI.</description>

      <title>Oracle launches Oracle 10G Express Edition - Big news or little?</title>

      <description>Oracle has just launched 10G Express Edition, a stripped down version of their mainstream DB. The limits appear to be very similar to MSDE or SQL Server 2005 Express (1 CPU, 4GB DB, 1GB RAM). This should be big news. Oracle have absolutely no penetration at the low end where MySQL and (funnily enough) MSDE dominate. But some serious issues mean that maybe it isn&amp;rsquo;t such big news after all.</description>
