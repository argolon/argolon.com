      <description>Cross-posting from the Cork OpenCoffee Blog: What started as a discussion about having an OpenCoffee in the Midlands the other day quickly turned into a proposal for an OpenBBQ in Terryglass on Lough Derg this summer.
Think business networking, free Wifi, top class BBQ and fun.
Evert has all the details so far. Please drop him a line if you think you might go. Heâ€™s thinking June/July mid-week. If there is enough interest from Cork OpenCoffee we could consider hiring a mini-bus?</description>
