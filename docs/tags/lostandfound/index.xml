      <description>Just spotted that the YouGetItBack guys in Cork nowhave a blog. It&amp;rsquo;s all about the business of Lost and Found and whilst they only started on Monday, the posts are flying in.
I wrote about them on my personal blog wayyy back in June 2006 when I found out about their initial product/service. It was a great idea then and it still is now. Buy a sticker for your phone/iPod etc, register the sticker code, put sticker on item.</description>
