      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re really excited at Argolon HQ to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve been accepted on to the Genesis Enterprise Programme. We&amp;rsquo;ve had lots of dealings with both the Rubicon Centre and GEP over the past year through Cork OpenCoffee and have been thoroughly impressed with the whole operation.
I&amp;rsquo;ve presented LouderVoice to Denise Kennedy, who runs GEP, twice over the past 18 months. I can honestly say it didn&amp;rsquo;t go well the first time.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to see that the YouGetItBack guys have launched the Beta versions of Laptop Superhero andÂ Mobile Superhero (love the branding!). These are applications you install and are activated when your device is lost or stolen. For the well-intentioned finder, the app tells them how to contact YGIB so that they can return the device to you. For the badly-intentioned finder, it locks the devices down so they cannot be used.</description>
