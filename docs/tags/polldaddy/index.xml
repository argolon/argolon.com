      <description>Gordon Murray of eWrite was asking on Twitter this evening what people thought of the idea of him documenting publicly the development of his new product and the business around it. In other words, blogging about it, warts and all.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a superb idea and could be of great benefit both to his business and to others who read it. If he can build a good readership then it could become a focal point for people to discuss lots of the standard issues around building a technology business in Ireland.</description>

      <description>Not just because it is a brilliant product but also because Lenny, Jonathan and the guys have shown that small Irish technology companies can have global reach!
These guys pushed out 14 million polls last month and over half of them were non-English-language.
Vote early and often.</description>

      <description>We were chuffed to bits and tickled pink this morning to see that David Lenehan has done an article about Irish webapps on the very highly regarded Read/WriteWeb site and we got a mention!
Thanks guys.
He also profiled some of the older guys like Pigsback and newer ones like Pixenate, Putplace and Nooked and not forgetting PollDaddy itself.
If you liked what David had to say, maybe consider voting for it over at Digg?</description>
