      <description>We had a wonderful night at the Irish Blog Awards on Saturday. Big congrats to Kieran Murphy who won Best Business Blog (and Best Speciality Blog) and Bernie Goldbach who won Best Technology Blogger (and Best Contribution to the Irish Bloggersphere which he in turn gave to Damien). They are two of my favourite bloggers globally and richly deserve the awards.
Krishna De has also released the podcast of all the Business Blog nominees discussing blogging last week.</description>

      <description>Argolon has been short-listed for Best Business Blog in The Irish Blog Awards and I&amp;rsquo;ve been shortlisted for Best Technology Blogger (presumably for this blog and the LouderVoice one).

      <description>So get those votes in. Make sure to check out all the great nominees over at Jason Roe&amp;rsquo;s Blog and then vote in as many categories as possible. Just don&amp;rsquo;t vote more than once or you&amp;rsquo;ll be barred just like that time you tried to get into a nightclub with jeans on.</description>
