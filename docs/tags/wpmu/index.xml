      <description>Please please please stop changing what I write.
You don&amp;rsquo;t know best. I do!
If I enter three dots, I want three dots, not a bloody ellipsis.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want smart quotes.
Don&amp;rsquo;t replace my apostrophes with backticks.
I don&amp;rsquo;t want my perfectly valid nested XHTML trashed when you &amp;ldquo;fix&amp;rdquo; it.
If I enter a div in the Rich Text Editor, I want a div, not a damned p.
I swear, this behaviour reminds me most of Microsoft Word.</description>

The Q&amp;amp;A; session didn&amp;rsquo;t last very long but did throw up some interesting points.
To kick off, there were various tech questions for Rob. Then Fergus was asked how long it took to launch Nooked, He replied that it was about a year after 3 different models. Walter was asked how he was hiring. He isn&amp;rsquo;t. There was a question about to get the right right developer expertise.</description>
