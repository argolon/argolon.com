      <description>The SBP has an excellent supplement about Cork in today&amp;rsquo;s edition. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll make it onto their web-site at some stage. Caroline Allen dedicated the entire back page to start-ups and include quotes from CorkBIC, Rubicon Centre, it@cork and Argolon/LouderVoice. The full piece is well worth a read, particularly considering the same message was coming loud and clear from us all. Hopefully someone in Government will read it and get that message!</description>
