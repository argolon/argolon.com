      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a busy few weeks.
 Two years after LouderVoice launched with the aim to make reviews more useful via Microformats, Google announced support, followed quickly by several of our competitors. What took ye so long? Then we launched Ireland&amp;rsquo;s first Google Android Mobile application Then we enabled the use of simple #review to identify mini-reviews on Twitter Then Krishna De of Biz Growth Newsreleased an extended interview with CEO Conor all about ratings and reviews.</description>

      <description>When one of the most famous web design gurus on the planet, whose books we adore, says he likes something you&amp;rsquo;ve built, well it&amp;rsquo;s a damned nice feeling indeed.
So Dan Cederholm likes LouderTweets.

We&amp;rsquo;ve been getting LouderTweets from as far away as Japan and The Philippines. Keep them coming.
Just to give a sense of the variety of those mini-reviews, some of the most recent were:
 A movie: &amp;ldquo;Live Free or Die Hard&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <title>LouderVoice Twitter Mash-Up</title>

      <description>After a few late nights we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to let you send reviews from Twitter to LouderVoice. We&amp;rsquo;re calling them LouderTweets and they are 140 character mini-reviews you can send using Web, SMS or IM via Twitter to LouderVoice.
An important point is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a LouderVoice member to send LouderTweets but you should join if you want to rate, bookmark and build/share useful collections of reviews and mini-reviews.</description>

      <title>LouderVoice Launches</title>

      <description>Last Wednesday we quietly unveiled LouderVoice. If you want a reviews site which takes a fundamentally different approach to everyone else then you&amp;rsquo;ll like what we have built.
Bloggers who write reviews now have a site which is built around enabling them to publish reviews to blogs in a widely accepted format. Everyone else now has a site where they can find great reviews, read them on those blogs and then rate them, share them and subscribe to more.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m testing out Scott Allan Wallick&amp;rsquo;s blog.txt theme. I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of Sandbox and this is very impressive too. Minimalist but attractive. It is also highly configurable and has lots of hAtom and hCard goodness built-in. I prefer it to the old one we had here. Thoughts anyone?</description>

      <description>If you need one reason, just one, why microformats are important, then you need to read Chris&#39; latest post about the hResume Wordpress plugin over at FactoryCity. His comments are not just specific to hResume, they are relevant for all microformat marked-up PCEK. PCEK (aka Peck) being a horrendous acronym I came up with about 10 minutes ago after reading Tim Bray and it means &amp;ldquo;People Contributed Experience and Knowledge&amp;rdquo;. The critical part of Chris&#39; post is</description>

      <title>This is huge - Yahoo Local supports microformats</title>

      <description>If you need any more convincing that Yahoo are back in the game then this announcement should do it.
The Yahoo Local Blog wrote:
 Starting today, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re happy to announce Yahoo! Local fully supports the hCalendar, hCard, and hReview microformats on almost all business listings, search results, events, and reviews.
 The trickle of data isn&amp;rsquo;t such a trickle any more. If we look back next year, will that announcement be seen as the tipping point?</description>

I met Fergus for the first time at the EI Web 2.0 Conference back in April but his reputation far preceded him. He has been described as the consummate networker but I think this does him an injustice - he is not just a genuine friendly guy, he is a doer. Whilst have the tech world talks about Web 2.</description>

Salim gave a suberb presentation which for me, as expected, was the highlight of the conference. I have heard chunks of the presentation on various Podcasts and it is still very focused on the ideas they built in PubSub despite the fact that Salim left there several months back. But given that those ideas remain as relevant now as they were when PubSub was founded, the presentation was compelling.</description>

I was supposed to attend a microformats dinner tonight in SF but was stymied by the impossibility of parking a car anywhere in that city. I returned to my hotel to catch up on the latest blogs to find a post from Tantek from Technorati announcing the launch of their microformats search.</description>
