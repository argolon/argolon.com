      <description>Founders of start-ups tend to spend a lot of time griping about things. I could write an essay on how it took from Aug 28th to Dec 3rd for Enterprise Ireland to issue a document needed to get us BES approval. Instead I&amp;rsquo;d like to focus on the positive part of that story.
On Dec 3rd, EI shuffled the paperwork-exercise out the door and it arrived in the Revenue Commissioners. Our solicitors also submitted our RICT outline application around the same time.</description>

      <description>A workshop on the 2007-2013 Business Expansion Scheme (BES) and Seed Capital Scheme (SCS) will take place on Monday 12th November at 13:00 p.m. in the Rubicon Centre.
The Revenue Commissioners (Cillian Byrne &amp;amp; Susan Cummins) will be presenting and Gerry O’Brien, Enterprise Ireland will also be in attendance. Focused on startup and developing companies, the format is a workshop as it is intended to be interactive and give you plenty of opportunity for questions and answers.</description>

      <title>New BES limits OKed by EU!</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2007/08/28/new-bes-limits-oked-by-eu/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just heard (via Joe Drumgoole&amp;rsquo;s blog) that the new BES limits annnounced last November have finally been approved by the EU. This is fantastic news.
This is the official EU newsletter announcement:
Notification or Registration Date:	23.05.2007 DG Responsible:	Competition DG Related Procedures:	N 311 / 2004
Decision on 23.08.2007:	Article 4§3 - decision not to raise objections
This presumably means that Enterprise Ireland should be processing new company certs starting five days ago and the Revenue Commissioners should be approving RICTs.</description>
