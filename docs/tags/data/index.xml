      <description>So we&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the horror stories of people going abroad and using the data connection on the phone and being charged €5k by Vodafone.
I was in the UK twice recently and on the first occasion had to make a quick data connection so Nokia Maps could figure out where I was. Of course I was then petrified that the 200KB would end up costing €100. However, when I checked my bill online, it showed the connection alright but the charge was zero!</description>
