      <description>Gordon Murray from eWrite is a Cork OpenCoffee stalwart and his eWrite business has been very successful in Ireland. They provide web CMSes and Apps for SMEs. They have put a lot of work into protecting the forms on their customers sites against spam and recently decided to spin this out as a product in itself.
This is one of those simple but extremely useful apps. You can select from a set of forms on the eWrite Forms site and then embed that on your own site.</description>
