      <description>Ewan Spence slices through the usual fan-boy nonsense and looks forward to the Jobs keynote at MacWorld. Let him know what you think.
Whilst it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to flick photos with your index finger, I prefer a phone that has phone features like 3G, HSDPA, Bluetooth etc.
And why does no-one ever comment on the Apple TV flop?
Review of the best business phone ever made, the Nokia N95 8GB, coming soon.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking recently about Nokia and my general feeling is that they are missing many simple opportunities to retain leadership in mobile development.
Apart from one crappy Panasonic and a dog-slow Sony-Ericcson T610, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Nokia phones. They have been solid workhorses with just the right combination of features for me. Until last year, that meant Series 40 phones but I then finally succumbed and bought an N70 a year ago.</description>
