      <description>My blood can stop boiling now. The EU has turned down the objection regarding the new BES scheme by the employment-haters in the ICTU.

      <description>In our first Python post we mentioned that there can be push-back on the usage of Python in solutions for customers, particularly if the entire system is to be built in Python.

This is Python reimplemented in Java and it provides features which are compelling both from a technical perspective and customer acceptance perspective. To the customer, Jython can be viewed as simply another part of a Java based solution where it is providing some scripting, automation and high-level glue.</description>
