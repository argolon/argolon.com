Revamped Technorati launched Jul 24, 2006 by
Conor O&#39;Neill  website
Technorati
 ★★★★☆ Just a quick mini-review: First off, I&#39;m a huge fan of Technorati and love nearly everything they do. Secondly, I think uncluttered web pages should be mandatory. But despite this I&#39;m just not sure about the re-design. It doesn&#39;t look finished (or something), maybe it is the excess of whitespace. More importantly, it only lists one blog for me on the front page but shows all of them when I drill down.</description>

I was supposed to attend a microformats dinner tonight in SF but was stymied by the impossibility of parking a car anywhere in that city. I returned to my hotel to catch up on the latest blogs to find a post from Tantek from Technorati announcing the launch of their microformats search.</description>

      <description>As the M.D.&amp;rsquo;s first employer was S3 (Silicon &amp;amp; Software Systems), we were delighted yesterday to read that they have received Ã¢â€šÂ¬10m in funding. Since their founding around 1986 by Maurice Whelan with backing from Philips they have grown from strength to strength. Like us all they suffered badly post-crash but have recovered incredibly well. The new funding should really enable them to build on that.
Mossie really is one of the unsung visionaries of the Irish tech sector.</description>
