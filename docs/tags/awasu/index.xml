      <description>I recently passed comment that the Juice podcast receiver could not see the MP3&amp;rsquo;s embedded in Tantek&amp;rsquo;s feed. I assumed wrongly that there was something wrong with the feed. But he pointed out that Juice must not support ATOM 1.0 yet. From what I can see, development on Juice has stalled which is a pity as it is a fine tool.
Tantek says that iTunes 6.0 does support ATOM 1.0 but that is no good to me as I refuse to install software which is built on the basis of controlling users.</description>
