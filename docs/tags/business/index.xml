I don&amp;rsquo;t need to add anything except, please listen to the man, he knows what he is talking about.</description>

      <description>Very good idea from West Cork Enterprise Board:
They are running 3 one-day Idea Generation Workshops over the coming weeks. The workshops are for people who are thinking about starting their own business but don’t have a business idea in mind yet and also people who have a business idea but want to study the idea further.
They will help people decide whether self-employment is the right route for them. Topics covered during the workshop will include: What does it mean to be an entrepreneur?</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work recently for the County and City Enterprise Boards and have been finding out about the Student Enterprise Awards. I am so incredibly jealous of today&amp;rsquo;s teenagers, I would have loved to be involved in something like that in school.
Approx 12000 students take part every year and some great ideas bubble to the top every time. They just had the 2008 awards ceremony last week and Banagher College from Co.</description>

      <description>Gordon Murray of eWrite was asking on Twitter this evening what people thought of the idea of him documenting publicly the development of his new product and the business around it. In other words, blogging about it, warts and all.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a superb idea and could be of great benefit both to his business and to others who read it. If he can build a good readership then it could become a focal point for people to discuss lots of the standard issues around building a technology business in Ireland.</description>

      <title>A possible web solution for small/micro biz</title>

      <description>We had a great exchange of ideas on the previous post about ways of getting very small businesses online. Of particular interest to me are the companies with zero technical ability who just need a solution which involves them typing in some information about their company and then they have a web-presence.
One solution for this type of business is eWrite &amp;ldquo;Cork&amp;rdquo;. Up until now the eWrite guys, John and Gordon, have been focused more on the Small to Medium end of the market rather than the Micro to Small.</description>

      <title>Great news for S3</title>

      <description>As the M.D.&amp;rsquo;s first employer was S3 (Silicon &amp;amp; Software Systems), we were delighted yesterday to read that they have received Ã¢â€šÂ¬10m in funding. Since their founding around 1986 by Maurice Whelan with backing from Philips they have grown from strength to strength. Like us all they suffered badly post-crash but have recovered incredibly well. The new funding should really enable them to build on that.
Mossie really is one of the unsung visionaries of the Irish tech sector.</description>
