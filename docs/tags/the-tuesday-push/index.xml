      <description>Cross-posted from Web2Ireland:
Damien Mulley gets community like very few other people in the industry. His ideas are always worth listening to and, more importantly, worth acting on. He has just kicked off a real corker called The Tuesday Push. Every second Tuesday, a startup is selected from those who put themselves forward and lots of us blog about them on the same day.
It&amp;rsquo;s one of those simple but potentially incredibly powerful ways of getting us all noticed.</description>
