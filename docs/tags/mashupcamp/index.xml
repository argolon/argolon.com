      <description>OK here&amp;rsquo;s the deal.
On Thursday September 13th, an event called DemoBar is being held. This is a chance for 10 web startups to demo their product to an audience consisting of their peers, the press, Irish investors, UK investors, Enterprise Ireland, the Future of WebApps conference organisers and a bunch of other people.
Not only that but we&amp;rsquo;ll be announcing shortly on the Web2Ireland.org site that EI is arranging for a pitch training session that afternoon for both Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley attendees and DemoBar participants.</description>
