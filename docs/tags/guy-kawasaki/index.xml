      <description>A few years back we were pitching to a large customer for a piece of work. This customer had a lot of problems and we spent two days listening to them pour their hearts out to us. Towards the end we identified a few specific things we would be able to improve for them in a major way and limited our commitments to that. As we were leaving, they thanked us for being the first vendor in a long time who really listened properly to them and didn&amp;rsquo;t just try to sell them a bunch of inappropriate software.</description>
