      <description>David Lenehan has written a great overview of the Open Coffee phenomenon. Cork gets a mention. If you have any interest in building the start-up culture and community in Ireland then it is a must-read. If you like it, please Digg it too.</description>

      <description>This post should have been written over a week ago but I&amp;rsquo;m only finally getting the time now.
On Thursday 10th May, three of us from Cork Open Coffee (Walter Higgins, David Copithorne and myself) headed over to London Open Coffee. As someone who has never worked into the UK (The Netherlands and Germany being my main destinations in the past), I was pretty impressed to find myself standing outside the door of Waterstones on Regent Street at 9.</description>

      <description>We had another good turnout this morning at Open Coffee and covered a lot of ground from technology companies not building good links with content companies to quite a long discussion about aims and metrics associated with Cork Open Coffee.
Haydn made some strong points about the fact that many web businesses are very heavily involved in content (the classic User Generated Content) but they seem to focus on business networking in a technology realm.</description>

      <description>We had the second Cork Open Coffee meet-up last Friday. As expected the numbers were down slightly but I was thrilled to see that over half the faces were new and we had some great additions to the attendee profile.
I had hoped when we kicked off OpenCoffee here that it would not just be about web people doing web stuff but would reach out to other technology business areas. So I was delighted to say hi to someone working in telecoms, to a developer from the Bay area (no not Bantry Bay) and to two people, new to the region, who work in multimedia and video production.</description>

      <description>Head on down to Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s any time between 10 and 12 and there should be some of us there talking tech and business and maybe a little Heroes. Particularly interested in talking to people about Coworking possibilities today.</description>

      <description>Wow that was some morning in Luigi Malone&amp;rsquo;s! I&amp;rsquo;d never been there before and the venue was just perfect. I arrived in to find a few of the guys along with Don the owner who stayed for the entire session. A huge thanks to Don for covering the cost of the refreshments today and for getting Wifi installed with almost no notice.
We had 20+ people turn up with the exact mix I was hoping for:</description>
