      <description>Byte &amp;amp; Switch report that Adaptec Says Sayonara to Systems
This is a sad end to the Eurologic story. We have watched them grow from a tiny operation in the early 1990&amp;rsquo;s to their coup in getting an OEM deal with Dell.

At that point everyone thought they would be back on an upwards trajectory but it looks like it was not to be.</description>
