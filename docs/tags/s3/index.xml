      <description>The buzz surrounding microformats and how they can be used to create new and better services is getting louder and louder. In the past month there have been some eye-opening blog postings and articles on them.
Here are just a few to whet the appetite:
Phil Haack has the best introduction to microformats I have read.
Alex Barnett coins a new acronym with mRc = microformats + RSS + clipboard. His article and Jason Kolb&amp;rsquo;s really address some of the exciting possibilities presented by Ray Ozzie&amp;rsquo;s Live Clipboard.</description>

      <description>As the M.D.&amp;rsquo;s first employer was S3 (Silicon &amp;amp; Software Systems), we were delighted yesterday to read that they have received Ã¢â€šÂ¬10m in funding. Since their founding around 1986 by Maurice Whelan with backing from Philips they have grown from strength to strength. Like us all they suffered badly post-crash but have recovered incredibly well. The new funding should really enable them to build on that.
Mossie really is one of the unsung visionaries of the Irish tech sector.</description>
