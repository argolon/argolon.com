      <description>One aspect of blogging (particularly business blogging) that worries some people is when something negative is written about them. This can sometimes erupt into a blogstorm with a huge hullabaloo across multiple blogs. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen a few over the past few years and each company/person handled it differently.
Frank Prendergast has written a very thoughtful post on this topic and I&amp;rsquo;ll be recommending it to all new (and old!) bloggers. The essence of his advice is to keep a level head, state your case, apologise if you are in the wrong and move on.</description>

      <title>Great news for S3</title>

      <description>As the M.D.&amp;rsquo;s first employer was S3 (Silicon &amp;amp; Software Systems), we were delighted yesterday to read that they have received Ã¢â€šÂ¬10m in funding. Since their founding around 1986 by Maurice Whelan with backing from Philips they have grown from strength to strength. Like us all they suffered badly post-crash but have recovered incredibly well. The new funding should really enable them to build on that.
Mossie really is one of the unsung visionaries of the Irish tech sector.</description>
