      <description>Ryan Carson has a good post on outsourcing in the context of DropSend and Amigo. I like his metrics on when to know you are in trouble. His Russian approach is interesting but as he points out, you have to know someone who knows the local scene to do it comfortably.
I&amp;rsquo;ll update our progress here with outsourcing with part three in our series (part 1, part 2) when I get back from FoWA.</description>
