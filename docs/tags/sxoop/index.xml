      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re really excited at Argolon HQ to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve been accepted on to the Genesis Enterprise Programme. We&amp;rsquo;ve had lots of dealings with both the Rubicon Centre and GEP over the past year through Cork OpenCoffee and have been thoroughly impressed with the whole operation.
I&amp;rsquo;ve presented LouderVoice to Denise Kennedy, who runs GEP, twice over the past 18 months. I can honestly say it didn&amp;rsquo;t go well the first time.</description>

For out and out geekful rapture, Walter&amp;rsquo;s presentation was a joy. I think it was a very necessary presentation to give (and provided a very nice counter-point to Rob&amp;rsquo;s which followed). There is a perception I think, particularly amongst a lot of the Web 2.0 tech press who appear to have no technical background, that creating a new Ajaxian WebApp is a weekends work mashing a few libraries and services together and alakazamm, it just works.</description>
