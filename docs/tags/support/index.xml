      <description>Very good idea from West Cork Enterprise Board:
They are running 3 one-day Idea Generation Workshops over the coming weeks. The workshops are for people who are thinking about starting their own business but donâ€™t have a business idea in mind yet and also people who have a business idea but want to study the idea further.
They will help people decide whether self-employment is the right route for them. Topics covered during the workshop will include: What does it mean to be an entrepreneur?</description>
