      <description>As LouderVoice races towards full launch, we have a requirement for someone to do CSS and XHTML work for us between now and then. Basically this person will have to take our existing design, apply it to any new features and pages on the site and tweak what is there already.
This isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge amount of work (time-scale is over the next few weeks and effort is probably less than a person-week), does not require design expertise and would suit anyone between major contracts or looking for a nice side project to exercise their mark-up muscles.</description>
