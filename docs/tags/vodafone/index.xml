      <description>I got an unlocked HTC G1 from the US recently for a project we are working on. This is the first Google Android phone and I&amp;rsquo;ll be doing a full review soon. The first thing you have to do is activate the phone with Google and I immediately ran into problems. It turns out you need to add the Irish mobile network Access Points to the phone so it knows how to connect to the internet.</description>

      <title>Top Travel Tip</title>

      <description>I mentioned before that a few months back I was in London for an event and I decided to forego my laptop and just bring my Nokia N95-8GB. This would provide e-mail, RSS reading and Twitter. Of course I was petrified of the roaming data charges that can happen abroad and made sure to just use Wifi where possible. Unfortunately my hotel room had a very poor wifi signal so I decided to bite the bullet and check my email using the (much maligned by me) Vodafone Live APN on the phone.</description>

      <title>Top Tip for Vodafone Ireland users</title>

      <description>So we&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the horror stories of people going abroad and using the data connection on the phone and being charged €5k by Vodafone.
I was in the UK twice recently and on the first occasion had to make a quick data connection so Nokia Maps could figure out where I was. Of course I was then petrified that the 200KB would end up costing €100. However, when I checked my bill online, it showed the connection alright but the charge was zero!</description>

      <title>Crack Addicts</title>

      <description>Is there any other phrase to describe the mobile operators? From Vodafone&amp;rsquo;s rip-off hamstrung data plans to the O2&amp;rsquo;s Paddy Tax on the iPhone, they&amp;rsquo;d take money from a baby to keep their unsustainable ARPUs up. &amp;ldquo;Hey Baby Phones! No-one has done baby phones. That&amp;rsquo;s an untapped demographic. We could coat the phones in sugar.&amp;rdquo;
Supposedly these operators know our business and their own. I guess that explains iMode. But perhaps they are getting a clue?</description>

      <title>Vodafone - Staring into the Abyss</title>
      <link>https://argolon.com/2007/12/23/vodafone-staring-into-the-abyss/</link>

      <description>I have come to the conclusion that Vodafone will be roadkill on the path to ubiquitous connectivity. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to several mobile operators in the past year and they all accept that they must become internet companies, they just don&amp;rsquo;t know how. This indecision will be fatal if Google decides to go global with Android and their spectrum purchases. Given my experiences as a simple punter in the past two weeks, can I beseech Google to buy the Three network off Hutchison Whampoa and show this relic of the 20th century what execution is all about?</description>

      <title>Will Nokia wake up like they did with paper products?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking recently about Nokia and my general feeling is that they are missing many simple opportunities to retain leadership in mobile development.
Apart from one crappy Panasonic and a dog-slow Sony-Ericcson T610, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Nokia phones. They have been solid workhorses with just the right combination of features for me. Until last year, that meant Series 40 phones but I then finally succumbed and bought an N70 a year ago.</description>
