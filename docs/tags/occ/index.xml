      <description>Cross-posting from the Cork OpenCoffee Blog: What started as a discussion about having an OpenCoffee in the Midlands the other day quickly turned into a proposal for an OpenBBQ in Terryglass on Lough Derg this summer.
Think business networking, free Wifi, top class BBQ and fun.
Evert has all the details so far. Please drop him a line if you think you might go. Heâ€™s thinking June/July mid-week. If there is enough interest from Cork OpenCoffee we could consider hiring a mini-bus?</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s not often that people and technology come together so brilliantly as this morning&amp;rsquo;s Limerick OpenCoffee. I&amp;rsquo;ve just taken part in their regular session whilst sitting in a kitchen in Wexford.
Conn O Muineachain livestreamed the entire event using Ustream.tv so anyone could logon and see what was happening whilst a chat-channel allowed us to interact with the attendees. Some backchannel stuff on Twitter and Jaiku added to the mix. If that&amp;rsquo;s all they had done, then it rates as a great success.</description>
