      <description>Well as ever it looks like Valleywag is about as accurate as the National Enquirer and I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be spreading their rubbish rumours. Fergus has stated that the story is untrue. It was just one of those stories that grows because it makes perfect sense even if it is not true.
Not that I&amp;rsquo;d ever believe a word on Valleywag but they are reporting that Feedburner has bought Nooked. If it&amp;rsquo;s true then huge congrats to Fergus and the team, it is much deserved.</description>

I met Fergus for the first time at the EI Web 2.0 Conference back in April but his reputation far preceded him. He has been described as the consummate networker but I think this does him an injustice - he is not just a genuine friendly guy, he is a doer. Whilst have the tech world talks about Web 2.</description>
