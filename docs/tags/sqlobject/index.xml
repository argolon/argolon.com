      <description>We recently had to do a very fast turn-around proof-of-concept for a Web-based Dashboard/Portal/UI on a reasonably straightforward relational schema in SQL Server.
As this was to be a throw-away development, we decided to leverage it for some internal training and feasibility study. We try to avoid buzzword bingo and don&amp;rsquo;t jump on every new technology/toolkit just because the usual suspects over at Slashdot are raving about it. Hence we&amp;rsquo;ll probably get around to looking at Ruby-on-Rails in 2007 if it is still in active development.</description>
