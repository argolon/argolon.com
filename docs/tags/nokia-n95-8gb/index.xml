      <description>I mentioned before that a few months back I was in London for an event and I decided to forego my laptop and just bring my Nokia N95-8GB. This would provide e-mail, RSS reading and Twitter. Of course I was petrified of the roaming data charges that can happen abroad and made sure to just use Wifi where possible. Unfortunately my hotel room had a very poor wifi signal so I decided to bite the bullet and check my email using the (much maligned by me) Vodafone Live APN on the phone.</description>

      <description>Ewan Spence slices through the usual fan-boy nonsense and looks forward to the Jobs keynote at MacWorld. Let him know what you think.
Whilst it&amp;rsquo;s nice to be able to flick photos with your index finger, I prefer a phone that has phone features like 3G, HSDPA, Bluetooth etc.
And why does no-one ever comment on the Apple TV flop?
Review of the best business phone ever made, the Nokia N95 8GB, coming soon.</description>
