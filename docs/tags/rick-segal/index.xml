      <description>Tom Raftery has posted that Rick Segal &amp;amp; Shel Israel are visiting Cork on Sept 9th as part of their world tour.
They are having a meet-up in Taste of Thailand and would love to talk to people with great ideas who can help them see how tech entrepreneurialism will evolve in Ireland over the next few years. They are also available to meet earlier in the day but will shoot anyone who appears with a powerpoint.</description>
