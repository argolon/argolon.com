      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m hitting Amsterdam at 5pm tomorrow for both the International OCC and TheNextWeb Conference. I&amp;rsquo;ll demo LouderVoice to as many people as I can and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the VC Speed Pitching session at lunchtime Friday. I&amp;rsquo;d better practice my elevator pitch tonight.
If you want to contact me from midday Thursday onwards I&amp;rsquo;ll be on +372-53-166646 (roam4free) or +353-87-9790297 (main mobile). I&amp;rsquo;ll be grabbing email on Thursday evening and probably not again until Friday night.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re attending TheNextWeb Conference in Amsterdam on June 1st. It looks like it will be an awesome day and we are aiming to show off LouderVoice to a big audience. The organisers have put together an awards site and we&amp;rsquo;d really appreciate a vote for LouderVoice in the Beta &amp;amp; Stealth Category. Whilst you are there, a vote for Pixenate in the Disruptors Category would make a lot of sense!</description>
