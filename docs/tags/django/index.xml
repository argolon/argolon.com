      <description>Just a quick mention of a neat new app that launched recently called LifeSux daily. It was developed by the same guy who now does all the heavy lifting on LouderVoice. It is another example of high speed development using Python and Django like the recently launched Matt.
The ideas is simple:
We designed LifeSuxDaily.com to let you share, with the community, those situations when you start feeling that life is a bitch and let you die ;) and get its feedback through comments and votes.</description>
