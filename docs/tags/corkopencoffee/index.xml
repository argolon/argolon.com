      <title>OpenBBQ in Tipperary?</title>

      <description>Cross-posting from the Cork OpenCoffee Blog: What started as a discussion about having an OpenCoffee in the Midlands the other day quickly turned into a proposal for an OpenBBQ in Terryglass on Lough Derg this summer.
Think business networking, free Wifi, top class BBQ and fun.
Evert has all the details so far. Please drop him a line if you think you might go. Heâ€™s thinking June/July mid-week. If there is enough interest from Cork OpenCoffee we could consider hiring a mini-bus?</description>

      <title>Leitrim Business Network</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m really pleased to see how well the Leitrim Business Network is taking off. Johnny Beirne from Leitrim CEB and the team are really pushing it forward. I love seeing them evangelise the opportunities presented by online networking through tools like LinkedIn and of course the site itself is a group blog.
it@cork has shown how useful and influential a professional local business network can be, particularly one that understands technology.</description>

      <description>Gordon Murray from eWrite is a Cork OpenCoffee stalwart and his eWrite business has been very successful in Ireland. They provide web CMSes and Apps for SMEs. They have put a lot of work into protecting the forms on their customers sites against spam and recently decided to spin this out as a product in itself.
This is one of those simple but extremely useful apps. You can select from a set of forms on the eWrite Forms site and then embed that on your own site.</description>

      <description>I did a short interview with Emma McNamara this afternoon for Radio 1. The overall theme of her piece was &amp;ldquo;The Economy&amp;rdquo; and as with other items in the series they took a regional focus which was Cork/Munster on this occasion.
I talked for far too long about the start-up scene down here, Open Coffee, LouderVoice, PaddysValley, the Ireland=Romania state of Venture Capital here and the difficulty many have in getting access to capital.</description>
