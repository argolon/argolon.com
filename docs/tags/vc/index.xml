      <description>On Tuesday, I was on TodayFM&amp;rsquo;s The Last Word radio show with Professor Frank Roche talking to Matt Cooper. The topic was centered on fund raising in the current economic climate. You can hear what we had to say in this audio clip. The interview starts about 4 minutes 30 seconds in.
Don&amp;rsquo;t forget that our 2008 BES offering is open until Dec 31st. The response to-date has been very positive.</description>

      <description>At the Essential Web conference last week Saul Klein announced SeedCamp. This is an incredibly important initiative that will help grow the spirit of entrepreneurship across Europe. It basically takes a YCombinator type model and implements it here.
For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, YCombinator is hugely successful project of Paul Graham in the US. Twice a year, once in Boston, once in SV, they ask (pre)startups to apply for a slot on the program.</description>

      <description>Go, read Ben Barren&amp;rsquo;s post on &amp;quot; Who Will Fund Local Web 2.0 Aussie Businesses?&amp;quot; and replace Australia everywhere with Ireland.
It&amp;rsquo;s a simple formula, I believe it can work.
Anything is better than where we are right now. When your VC activity is mentioned in the same sentence as Romania, you know you have a deep deep problem to solve.
A report onour visit to London Open Coffee coming later.</description>

      <description>Keith has uploaded videos of the &amp;ldquo;Finding money for your start-up&amp;rdquo; session. I enjoyed the differing views of the panel on this topic but anyone who thought they&amp;rsquo;d come away with &amp;ldquo;so that&amp;rsquo;s how I do it&amp;rdquo; would have been disappointed. There should definitely be a follow-up session at BarCamp Dublin with a focus on successful early-stage tech startup fund-raising.</description>

      <title>Great news for S3</title>

      <description>As the M.D.&amp;rsquo;s first employer was S3 (Silicon &amp;amp; Software Systems), we were delighted yesterday to read that they have received Ã¢â€šÂ¬10m in funding. Since their founding around 1986 by Maurice Whelan with backing from Philips they have grown from strength to strength. Like us all they suffered badly post-crash but have recovered incredibly well. The new funding should really enable them to build on that.
Mossie really is one of the unsung visionaries of the Irish tech sector.</description>
