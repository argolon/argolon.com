      <description>I use a bunch of different tools to do my blog posts, none of which I am entirely happy with so I was interested to see that Microsoft have released the Beta of a desktop blog writing tool.
I turned off the Rich Text Editor in Wordpress a long time ago as it was forever jamming paragraphs together for no obvious reason. I like Performancing but it has the same horrendous problem that ALL web-based writing tools have - if you accidentally hit the Back button on your mouse or nudge the mouse pad badly, you can lose all of your edits.</description>
