      <description>Read Pat Phelan&amp;rsquo;s post on &amp;ldquo;Irish Silicon Valley&amp;rdquo; now, right now.
I don&amp;rsquo;t need to add anything except, please listen to the man, he knows what he is talking about.</description>

      <description>Cross-posting from the LouderVoice Blog:
We are incredibly excited that an opportunity to attend TechCrunch40 in San Francisco next week has appeared. It is all due to the wonderful Pat Phelan of Cubic Telecom who offered a free ticket to a well deserving start-up. LouderVoice is that start-up and I&amp;rsquo;ll be there from Sunday until Wednesday afternoon.
If you are in the Bay area and would like to meet up and talk business and technology or you are from the investment community, I&amp;rsquo;d love to see you whilst I am there.</description>

      <description>Tom Raftery has posted that Rick Segal &amp;amp; Shel Israel are visiting Cork on Sept 9th as part of their world tour.
They are having a meet-up in Taste of Thailand and would love to talk to people with great ideas who can help them see how tech entrepreneurialism will evolve in Ireland over the next few years. They are also available to meet earlier in the day but will shoot anyone who appears with a powerpoint.</description>
