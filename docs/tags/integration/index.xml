      <description>After a few late nights we&amp;rsquo;re now ready to let you send reviews from Twitter to LouderVoice. We&amp;rsquo;re calling them LouderTweets and they are 140 character mini-reviews you can send using Web, SMS or IM via Twitter to LouderVoice.
An important point is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to be a LouderVoice member to send LouderTweets but you should join if you want to rate, bookmark and build/share useful collections of reviews and mini-reviews.</description>

      <description>Chip Hazard on Jeff Bussgang&amp;rsquo;s Blog has a great riposte to the assertion that the Enterprise software business is dying. In particular, his first point about driving IT efficiency is very relevant to our business area.
We spend most of our time developing custom solutions for clients who have made large up-front investments in enterprise applications and now want to maximise the return on that investment. In some case, this may simply be a case of extracting out data in a summary form from these systems so that they can make informed planning decisions.</description>
