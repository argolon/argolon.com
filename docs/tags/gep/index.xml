      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re really excited at Argolon HQ to announce that we&amp;rsquo;ve been accepted on to the Genesis Enterprise Programme. We&amp;rsquo;ve had lots of dealings with both the Rubicon Centre and GEP over the past year through Cork OpenCoffee and have been thoroughly impressed with the whole operation.
I&amp;rsquo;ve presented LouderVoice to Denise Kennedy, who runs GEP, twice over the past 18 months. I can honestly say it didn&amp;rsquo;t go well the first time.</description>
