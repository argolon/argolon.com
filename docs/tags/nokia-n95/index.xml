      <description>I mentioned before that a few months back I was in London for an event and I decided to forego my laptop and just bring my Nokia N95-8GB. This would provide e-mail, RSS reading and Twitter. Of course I was petrified of the roaming data charges that can happen abroad and made sure to just use Wifi where possible. Unfortunately my hotel room had a very poor wifi signal so I decided to bite the bullet and check my email using the (much maligned by me) Vodafone Live APN on the phone.</description>
