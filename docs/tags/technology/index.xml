      <description>My predictions for 2008 were very hit and miss (mainly miss), here&amp;rsquo;s a quick re-cap:
  Cubic Telecom will have a Â£100m exit
 * Not yet. 2008 was an amazing year for Pat and the team with deals happening at breakneck pace.    European Founders, Howzat Media, TAG or Advent will do a deal with a web or mobile start-up here
 * Again not yet. I still think this will happen    More foreign VCs will invest in Irish web start-ups than Irish VCs</description>
