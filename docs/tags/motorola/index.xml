      <description>Deirdre Lacey from it@cork contacted me to tell me about a page they have put on their site:
The page allows staff from Motorola to post their details if they are job seeking. Prospective employers can follow up directly with candidates via email links. This system has worked very well is similar circumstances throughout the country.
it@Cork wish all Motorola employees well in their future plans.
This is a wonderful idea and I hope it works well for all involved.</description>
