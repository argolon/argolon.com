      <description>Read Pat Phelan&amp;rsquo;s post on &amp;ldquo;Irish Silicon Valley&amp;rdquo; now, right now.
I don&amp;rsquo;t need to add anything except, please listen to the man, he knows what he is talking about.</description>

      <description>Given the interest expressed in having a SeedCamp prep session, Gordon Murray has arranged a room in Oriel House Hotel in Ballincollig, Cork for Thursday August 7th starting at 9am.
It will be quite informal, the aim is to get practical advice from each other on answering some of the questions on the application form so that you promote your business or idea as best as possible.
He’ll have printouts of the questions with him on the day.</description>

      <title>No Irish Start-Ups Through To SeedCamp</title>

      <description>I was disappointed to see that no Irish start-ups made it through to the initial 20 on SeedCamp. My gut tells me this is simply due to lack of applications. I only knew of one start-up here that applied. Did you? As the old ad goes &amp;ldquo;if you&amp;rsquo;re not in, you can&amp;rsquo;t win&amp;rdquo;.
Maybe when they see the great outcome for the winners of the first one, we&amp;rsquo;ll have more youngfellas and youngwans getting up of their bums and giving it a go.</description>

      <description>Saul Klein reports that they received over 260 applications from around Europe for SeedCamp. I hope there is a bunch of Irish ones in there!</description>

      <description>At the Essential Web conference last week Saul Klein announced SeedCamp. This is an incredibly important initiative that will help grow the spirit of entrepreneurship across Europe. It basically takes a YCombinator type model and implements it here.
For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, YCombinator is hugely successful project of Paul Graham in the US. Twice a year, once in Boston, once in SV, they ask (pre)startups to apply for a slot on the program.</description>
