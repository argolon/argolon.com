      <description>We decided to switch over to BT Ireland/EsatBT recently to try to minimise costs during the startup of the new venture. I know they are infamous for their incompetent billing but the value really is very good - The Total Talk + 3Mbs Broadband package blows Eircom out of the water.
But it looks like the billing department are not the only ones who need some training in BT. You cannot sign-up to their service online using either Firefox or IE7.</description>
