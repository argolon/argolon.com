      <description>The Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland VC Forum pitching event in Silicon Valley on Tuesday looks to have been a great event. Five Irish web start-ups pitched to a panel of local VCs and an invited audience. You can see all the videos over at the Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley blog. The really interesting part for me was the questions from the VCs. They have a very strong focus on competitive advantage. It&amp;rsquo;s well worth your time watching all five.</description>

      <description>OK here&amp;rsquo;s the deal.
On Thursday September 13th, an event called DemoBar is being held. This is a chance for 10 web startups to demo their product to an audience consisting of their peers, the press, Irish investors, UK investors, Enterprise Ireland, the Future of WebApps conference organisers and a bunch of other people.
Not only that but we&amp;rsquo;ll be announcing shortly on the Web2Ireland.org site that EI is arranging for a pitch training session that afternoon for both Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley attendees and DemoBar participants.</description>

      <description>The Irish Times has covered the latest press release about our Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley trip. The support of Enterprise Ireland in not just important but it is really getting noticed by the press. Finfacts also give us a mention and I was interviewed by Cork 103FM and ENN. There are still plenty of places left but we will be setting a cut-off date soon so head on over to the site, read all about it, ask questions, make comments and then sign up if you like the idea.</description>

      <description>Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley has a definite date and now a hotel. And soon maybe even a t-shirt. We&amp;rsquo;ll set a closing date for signing up soon and spaces are limited so I encourage you to do so today!
If you know anyone in the Valley who you think would like to meet a bunch of Irish start-ups and techies, please contact them and let them know the details. If they bite, let us know too.</description>

      <description>Apologies for the lack of information forthcoming about Paddy&amp;rsquo;s Valley, the blame lays firmly at my door. Few quick updates:
 1. The dates have been decided, December 2nd to December 9th 2. we now have [an official blog](http://paddysvalley.org/). Please subscribe to the RSS feed 3. [Damien has listed](http://www.mulley.net/2007/06/14/paddys-valley-what-exactly-do-we-want-to-do/) some of our ideas 4. Even if you signed up on the old wiki, please [re-sign up here](http://www.formspring.com/forms/paddysvalley-registration) 5. We&#39;re going to set a cut-off date for sign-ups very soon and we will probably be asking for a small deposit to cover basic expenses between now and the trip 6.</description>

      <description>We did this press release this morning. Please forward to anyone you think might have an interest:
An ad-hoc group of Irish business people have decided to form their own delegation to tour Silicon Valley and create closer bonds with companies and people in the mecca of the computer world. The tour nicknamed Ã¢â‚¬Å“PaddysValleyÃ¢â‚¬Â will head off at the start of November, taking advantage of the new air routes from Aer Lingus.</description>
