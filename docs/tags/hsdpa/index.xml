      <description>So we&amp;rsquo;ve all heard the horror stories of people going abroad and using the data connection on the phone and being charged €5k by Vodafone.
I was in the UK twice recently and on the first occasion had to make a quick data connection so Nokia Maps could figure out where I was. Of course I was then petrified that the 200KB would end up costing €100. However, when I checked my bill online, it showed the connection alright but the charge was zero!</description>

      <title>Vodafone - Staring into the Abyss</title>

      <description>I have come to the conclusion that Vodafone will be roadkill on the path to ubiquitous connectivity. I&amp;rsquo;ve talked to several mobile operators in the past year and they all accept that they must become internet companies, they just don&amp;rsquo;t know how. This indecision will be fatal if Google decides to go global with Android and their spectrum purchases. Given my experiences as a simple punter in the past two weeks, can I beseech Google to buy the Three network off Hutchison Whampoa and show this relic of the 20th century what execution is all about?</description>
