Salim gave a suberb presentation which for me, as expected, was the highlight of the conference. I have heard chunks of the presentation on various Podcasts and it is still very focused on the ideas they built in PubSub despite the fact that Salim left there several months back. But given that those ideas remain as relevant now as they were when PubSub was founded, the presentation was compelling.</description>
