      <description>Aidan Finn just announced Galway OCC on Twitter. Upcoming.org page here. I&amp;rsquo;d been hoping for this one, I think it&amp;rsquo;ll be a big success. Looking forward to the reports. That plus BarCamp Galway are two great excuses for us to head up there.</description>

Sorry I can&amp;rsquo;t make it this time. Next time I promise.

      <description>Haydn has offered up some quite controversial opinions on where many Irish web companies should put their energies and also what the BarCampDublin focus should be. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;d like to see argued from both points of view so please head over to Mediangler and offer your thoughts.</description>

      <description>Elly and the gang have been hard at work putting together BarCamp Dublin and it looks like a winner. This is the third one after Cork and Waterford and I love the look of the speaker line-up. If you are free at all on Saturday week I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to head over. Do sign-up so they know how many people to expect.
Some of the talks that catch my eye include:</description>

      <description>I attended my first UK Geek Dinner last night after FoWA. Guests of honour were Tara Hunt and Chris Messina. I only chatted to Chris for a short while towards the end of the night and the bulk of the conversation was about BarCamp. I told him how important I thought BarCamps have been for the creation of a vibrant tech community in Ireland. I also wanted to thank him and Tantek and the others for starting something that I think is a true revolution.</description>

      <description>Keith has uploaded videos of the &amp;ldquo;Finding money for your start-up&amp;rdquo; session. I enjoyed the differing views of the panel on this topic but anyone who thought they&amp;rsquo;d come away with &amp;ldquo;so that&amp;rsquo;s how I do it&amp;rdquo; would have been disappointed. There should definitely be a follow-up session at BarCamp Dublin with a focus on successful early-stage tech startup fund-raising.</description>
