      <description>The first ShareIT session was held yesterday in UCC. Unfortunately I had to leave early but I did catch Jenny Kent&amp;rsquo;s and Krishna De&amp;rsquo;s presentations both of which were excellent and full of practical nuggets rather than generalities. This is a genuinely valuable initiative for those starting out in tech businesses. I highly recommend attending the next one in Dublin on April 28th in the Microsoft offices.
My presentation on &amp;ldquo;Oursourcing - A Guide&amp;rdquo; is here as a PDF.</description>

      <description>The first ShareIT session is tomorrow. Remember, it is totally free and you&amp;rsquo;ll learn a bunch if you turn up. I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished writing my presentation on &amp;ldquo;Outsourcing - A Guide&amp;rdquo; and it&amp;rsquo;s a cracker :-)
More info on the Business Advisory site.

      <description>Damien has just announced the Share IT Free Training sessions which he has organised under the umbrella of BusinessAdvisory.ie. This is a fantastic idea where those with expertise in certain areas give training for free to those who are seeking it.
Initially it the focus is on IT/Technology but if it proves successful, I&amp;rsquo;m sure the scope will expand. I&amp;rsquo;m thrilled to be able to do my bit and share what little knowledge I have in a few areas on the first training day in UCC on March 24th.</description>
