      <description>I spent a very interesting afternoon talking to Christine O&amp;rsquo;Donovan in WCEB in Clonakilty on Tuesday. We covered a pretty wide range of topics and I was highly impressed by the range of services they offer local businesses.

Our big area of mutual frustration was the lack of take-up on the Tech-Check scheme. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it before on my personal blog and in summary, if you are a local biz in Ireland with even one laptop and you&amp;rsquo;ve never even talked to an Enterprise Board, then you are missing out hugely.</description>
