      <description>From ReadWriteWeb, Jaiku is to be shutdown.
I know a lot of webapp businesses are bought by Google and die through lack of attention. In our innocence, many of us thought Jaiku would be different. We thought there was a masterplan. We thought Jaiku would be the heart of the Android Address Book. The ultimate mobile social network with millions of users instantly.
We were completely and utterly wrong. Jaiku was bought to get some amazing minds, like Jyri.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking recently about Nokia and my general feeling is that they are missing many simple opportunities to retain leadership in mobile development.
Apart from one crappy Panasonic and a dog-slow Sony-Ericcson T610, I&amp;rsquo;ve always used Nokia phones. They have been solid workhorses with just the right combination of features for me. Until last year, that meant Series 40 phones but I then finally succumbed and bought an N70 a year ago.</description>

      <description>Jan Blanchard has been building a great travel site called Touristr for quite a while. I did some beta testing for him a while back and the potential was obvious. With their latest open beta, they&amp;rsquo;ve really improved the look and navigation of the site.
In their own words:
I think they have a winner on their hands.

      <title>Recommendations for Web Application Development shops?</title>

      <description>We intend to outsource the bulk of the development of our application. This will be broken down into several areas including:
 Design XHTML/CSS Application development Hosting Operations  I have received plenty of recommendations for Design and some for XHTML/CSS but other than Ryan Carson recommending Nick in Plum Digital Media (and more on yesterday&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;How to build a WebApp&amp;rdquo; workshop later), it is proving difficult to get recommendations for top-class web application development houses.</description>
