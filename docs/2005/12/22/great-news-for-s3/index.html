            <div class="post-content">
                <p>As the M.D.&rsquo;s first employer was <a href="http://www.s3group.com/">S3 (Silicon &amp; Software Systems)</a>, we were delighted yesterday to read that <a href="http://www.electricnews.net/news.html?code=9659486">they have received Ã¢â€šÂ¬10m in funding</a>. Since their founding around 1986 by Maurice Whelan with backing from Philips they have grown from strength to strength. Like us all they suffered badly post-crash but have recovered incredibly well. The new funding should really enable them to build on that.</p>
<p>Mossie really is one of the unsung visionaries of the Irish tech sector. A quiet thoughtful man who shuns the limelight, he was creating high-value employment in Ireland when the IDA still thought that bringing in luxury towel manufacturers was the direction to take.</p>
<p>Two slightly negative points about the announcement: Firstly, we received a stock e-mail from a PR person addressed to &ldquo;Dear  ,&rdquo;. We had sudden flashbacks to the first attempts at mass mailing from the early 1990&rsquo;s. It is simply unacceptable at the end of 2005 even for a local school newsletter to be badly mail-merged like that. We were also asked to include the news in &ldquo;our publication&rdquo;. What publication? If you have received Ã¢â€šÂ¬10m in funding, maybe it might be worth spending more than 5 minutes planning and executing the press releases? A quick search on Technorati brings up zero stories on &ldquo;S3&rdquo; or &ldquo;Silicon and Software Systems&rdquo;. That will change with this posting obviously.</p>
<p>Secondly, we really do live in the wrong country for tech funding. Whilst the S3 funding is great news, it is a sad reflection of the state of VC in Ireland. Here we have a company nearly 10 years old, with a rich history and deep pool of IP with several hundred employees and they get Ã¢â€šÂ¬10m. Meanwhile, in the same week, 3 nobodies in the US who come up the the gee-whiz &ldquo;IM on a web-page&rdquo; idea, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/12/16/meebo-confirms-sequoia-funding/">get $3m</a>!!! A strong case for &ldquo;Web 2.0 hubble bubble, no toil, we smell trouble&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Maybe now&rsquo;s the time to drop the same name as the video card guys? It was a perception problem in 1992 and it still is.</p>
<p>In any case, well done Maurice, John and all the gang in Leopardstown.</p>
