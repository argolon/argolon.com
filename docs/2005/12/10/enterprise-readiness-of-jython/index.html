            <div class="post-content">
                <p>In our first Python post we mentioned that there can be push-back on the usage of Python in solutions for customers, particularly if the entire system is to be built in Python.</p>
<p>An interesting alternative which can gain more customer acceptance is <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a>. This is Python reimplemented in  Java and it provides features which are compelling both from a technical perspective and customer acceptance perspective. To the customer, Jython can be viewed as simply another part of a Java based solution where it is providing some scripting, automation and high-level glue. For the developer, it opens up the facilites of Java to the Python interpreter and all the facilites of Python to the JVM.</p>
<p>Tim Bray (Mr XML, now in SUN) has  <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/05/03/Pedroni">a particularly good blog posting</a> on it.</p>
<p>So, in theory, we like it a lot, and we are particularly looking at it for integrating together existing Java sub-sytems from other vendors and from our customers. However, we are concerned about the history of its development which has been very stop-start and also the lag between it and the mainline Python interpreter. The alpha status of the current release would obviously have to change before we could consider doing a major customer development in it.</p>
<p>Are there any developers using this for Enterprise-level software with actual live, stable deployments in the field? If you are wondering what we mean by &ldquo;Enterprise-level&rdquo;, an example would be the system we delivered to a customer last December which has had 100% uptime over the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Tim Bray <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/08/DynamicJava">mentions that Propylon have deployed Jython systems in the field</a>, which is very interesting.</p>
<p>Additionally, as with the previous post, we are interested in feedback on development environments for Jython. We are currently playing with both <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/">PyDev</a> <a href="http://jydt.sourceforge.net/">JyDT</a> and  along with Editor+CLI and <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/12/08/DynamicJava">Coyote </a>on <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">Netbeans</a>.</p>
