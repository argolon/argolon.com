                <p>We recently had to do a very fast turn-around proof-of-concept for a Web-based Dashboard/Portal/UI on a reasonably straightforward relational schema in SQL Server.</p>
<p>As this was to be a throw-away development, we decided to leverage it for some internal training and feasibility study. We try to avoid buzzword bingo and don&rsquo;t jump on every new technology/toolkit just because the usual suspects over at Slashdot are raving about it. Hence we&rsquo;ll probably get around to looking at Ruby-on-Rails in 2007 if it is still in active development.</p>
<p>However, one very recent toolkit has caught our eye and that is <a href="http://www.turbogears.org/">TurboGears</a>.  The site describes it as &ldquo;the rapid web development megaframework you&rsquo;ve been looking for&rdquo;. It integrates together a set of existing tools into a very slick framework which enables one to very quickly generate web applications which front databases.</p>
<p>The developer in question had it installed in minutes and raced throught the example &ldquo;20 minute Wiki&rdquo;. We had our proof-of-concept ready in a week. At this point we have only scratched the surface of Turbogears but we have kicked off further investigation so that we can be in a position to potentially use it on our next Web-App development. It is another example of how Python is really helping us deliver for our customer base.</p>
