                <p>Business Objects have <a href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/developer/0,39020387,39235794,00.htm">announced that they are joining the Eclipse Foundation</a> and are going to Open Source some of their tools. This is a very timely move for them as there appears to be a lot of energy building behind their Open Source competitors which must surely be hurting sales of Crystal at the low-end.</p>
<p>Whilst none of the Open Source tools have the breadth and depth of Crystal&rsquo;s capabilities, in many cases they are &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;. Whilst we have been happily using Crystal and Crystal Enterprise/Server for quite a while now, the Open Source alternatives are becoming more and more attractive. It looks like the BO move is particularly targetting BIRT which is integrated into Eclipse, has a solid business model behind it and for which paid support (a must for many large enterprises) is available.</p>
<p>We have built our own capabilities with some of the leading products such as <a href="http://jasperreports.sourceforge.net/">JasperReports </a>(and related tools like <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/oreports">OpenReports</a> and <a href="http://ireport.sourceforge.net/">iReport</a>) and <a href="http://eclipse.org/birt/">BIRT</a>. Our developement services can now provide any of the above as part of an engagement.</p>
<p>The importance of an enterprise reporting system cannot be understated. To many people, reports mean bureaucratic paperwork for middle-management. But an accurate Business Intelligence System (an overused but accurate term) can mean the difference between running your infrastructure at 40% utilisation or 80%. It can allow you to plan asset purchases in advance based on usage trends rather than always having to be done during a fire-fight. In fact, a well-targetted BI System with both historical and up-to-date data will reduce the number of those fire-fights because you always know where you are and where you are going.</p>
<p>If you think you may have an Reporting/BI requirement and wish to discuss it further then don&rsquo;t hesitate to contact us. Even the smallest SME can benefit from having a better insight into the core metrics of their business operations and planning.</p>
