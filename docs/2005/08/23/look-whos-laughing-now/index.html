<p>The points regarding competition from Microsoft are not particularly well made by the interviewer. The new features in Reporting Services for SQL Server 2005 look like they could have a mjor impact on the BO bottom line in Microsoft-only accounts. The near-zero price of Reporting Services is something BO can have no answer to, without doing something extreme like OpenSourcing Crystal. Obviously, BO will continue to thrive in heterogeneous and non-MS environments but I know we cannot be the only ones looking at MS Reporting Services as a potential replacement for Crystal moving into 2006 for some engagements.</p>
