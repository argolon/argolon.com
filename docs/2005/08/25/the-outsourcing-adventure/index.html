<p>Over 13 years, in various companies, we have been involved in Outsourcing, Design Services, Consultancy and Professional Services and I don&rsquo;t think we have encountered many customers who would have analysed all of the issues mentioned in the EDS list. Generally we have found that for most it boils down to:</p>
<p>[1] We don&rsquo;t have the skills internally - outsource
[2] We are understaffed - outsource
[3] It&rsquo;s cheaper - outsource.</p>
<p>By doing a full and detailed analysis of each of the points brought up by the EDS posting, a customer can go a long way to avoiding disappointment in an outsourcing engagement.</p>
