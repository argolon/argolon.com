                <p>My business hero is my Dad. He left a secure job in Dublin to join a startup in Kilkenny in the early 1970&rsquo;s. This wasn&rsquo;t a tech startup, it was a dairy one, called Avonmore-Avongate. That team built a global business over the next few decades.</p>
<p>My most recent business hero is Pat Phelan. He overcame huge personal crisis to firstly build a great business locally and then build MaxRoam. What he has achieved with MaxRoam in those timescales is close to miraculous. Every chat with Pat consists of me going &ldquo;no way?!&rdquo; as he describes another major milestone.</p>
<p>Anyone doing a startup is going to have tons of criticism thrown at them. When I get reamed about LouderVoice by my peers, I value every word they say. The criticism is nearly always well-intentioned and I never take it personally.</p>
<p>However, when people who have never built anything in their lives, come along and throw insults around, making blanket criticisms of groups of companies or just make personal attacks, then that&rsquo;s a different matter. These desperate attention-seekers have never done anything except comment on other people&rsquo;s efforts. </p>

<p>Robert Scoble, who used to be well-known as a Microsoft blogger, s<a href="http://patphelan.net/robert-tonight-you-lost-that-shine/">lagged off a ton of companies</a> in his most recent link-baiting post. With his usual insight and depth, he said they sucked. I unsubbed from his blog over a year ago. Maybe if the rest of you do the same, he&rsquo;ll learn some manners and show some respect.</p>
