            <div class="post-content">
                <p>My predictions for 2008 were very hit and miss (mainly miss), here&rsquo;s a quick re-cap:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cubic Telecom will have a £100m exit</p>
<pre><code>  * Not yet. 2008 was an amazing year for Pat and the team with deals happening at breakneck pace.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>European Founders, Howzat Media, TAG or Advent will do a deal with a web or mobile start-up here</p>
<pre><code>  * Again not yet. I still think this will happen
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>More foreign VCs will invest in Irish web start-ups than Irish VCs</p>
<pre><code>  * Well they both hover around zero. With current climate, we could be waiting a long time for this.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the current batch of Irish Web 2.0 start-ups will go global in a big way</p>
<pre><code>  * PollDaddy!
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>EI’s €170m VC fund will continue to provide minimal benefits to Irish web start-ups</p>
<pre><code>  * I got that one 1000% correct
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eircom’s small fund will result in two major web start-up successes</p>
<pre><code>  * Sadly not yet but the signs are still good
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone will launch a full Y Combinator/Seedcamp here</p>
<pre><code>  * Sadly no. And with Government pissing away another €500m to foreign VCs this time, could they not take a €5m flutter with some smart entrepreneurs (no not VCs!) co-managing this?
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Minister John McGuinness will be given responsibility for re-structuring all state bodies concerned with business</p>
<pre><code>  * Again no. Will Government have the balls to shake everything up in 2009? €500m to foreign VCs says no.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>EI will absorb Údarás na Gaeltachta</p>
<pre><code>  * No.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>EI will launch a self-contained web unit with its own budget, minimal red-tape, firewall access to Facebook and based in the Cork Gaeltacht or Kilkenny</p>
<pre><code>  * No, big opportunity missed. The geo-centric model of EI needs to change to centres of expertise.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Damien Mulley will launch his own start-up</p>
<pre><code>  * Mulley Communications :-)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six Apart will launch a free version of Typepad</p>
<pre><code>  * No. Give it time tho.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Six Apart or Automattic will launch a full blown social network built on their blogging platforms</p>
<pre><code>  * No. I'm very surprised how long this is taking.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Facebook Sign-to-Noise will continue to plummet as more and more people join and repeat usage plateaus (How many FB apps did I have to install this week just to read happy new year messages?)</p>
<pre><code>  * SNR did plummet but usage didn't. I started to find FB more useful in the latter part of 2008 as all the vampire crap subsided.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be a management bloodbath at a high level in the mobile operators as they see ARPU drop on traditional services and continue to sit idly-by, unable to make sense of the mobile internet</p>
<pre><code>  * No. Bit by bit it looks like the mobile telcos are getting the hang of the internet. 
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google’s Mobile strategy will continue to peek out here and there and continue scare the bejesus out of the incumbents</p>
<pre><code>  * The strategy seems to be working well. The ones who are scared are not the telcos but Nokia and the non-Android handset makers. It looks like the mobile telcos are actually embracing Android.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first Google Android phone will be launched by HTC and won’t be fantastic</p>
<pre><code>  * I got this one right. I have a G1. The software is fantastic, the hardware mediocre. Review coming soon on LouderVoice.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon will merge with eBay</p>
<pre><code>  * No. They still should
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amazon will seriously impact Apple iTunes</p>
<pre><code>  * I believe they are making a bigger and bigger dent here. Android will accelerate this.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google will buy 3 (ok ok that’s wishlist too)</p>
<pre><code>  * No, not even close.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>RyanAir will buy 3 <img src="https://argolon.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)"></p>
<pre><code>  * Ditto.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ye know I cannot come up with one decent prediction about Microsoft. More of the same maybe?</p>
<pre><code>  * Live Mesh impresses the socks off me.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>The BBC will brand the OLPC XO as the BBC Micro Model D and launch a major combined TV and internet education program around it</p>
<pre><code>  * A little too bluesky for the BBC. Netbooks seem to have taken all the buzz here.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Google will buy Bebo</p>
<pre><code>  * Well they were bought but not by Google.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>One of the video 2.0 companies will be massive (Qik, Seesmic, Kyte, Ustream etc)</p>
<pre><code>  * Whilst not massive, both Qik and Ustream seem to be doing very well.
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dedicated generic Irish Social Network will be launched</p>
<pre><code>  * Both IGOpeople and Locle went live so I got that right!
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bandon and Old Chapel will get 12 Mbs broadband (that’s on the fantasy list)</p>
<pre><code>  * We got 3 Mbs. Better than a poke in the eye I guess
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Old Chapel residents will get flat-rate unencumbered 3.5G on our phones (ditto)</p>
<pre><code>  * Well I got 1GB for €8 from Voda last month so we're heading in the right direction
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>2008 will provide tougher challenges but greater rewards to Irish entrepreneurs than 2007</p>
<pre><code>  * Yes, absolutely.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<p>2009 predictions coming next</p>
