                <p>I really thought I would love this device considering how much I like its old N770 brother. However it completely misses the mark and I can find no place for it in my daily workflow. Dare I say it, I would prefer an iPod Touch!</p>
<p>Last May at Cork OpenCoffee, Gordon Murray told everyone about an amazing bargain on Expansys. Nokia N770 Internet Tablets were selling for approx €100. By the end of the coffee morning, more than 10 had been ordered and after a few hours humming and hawing I got one too.</p>
<p>Initially I loved it with its touch screen, wifi, bluetooth, web browser etc. Then I realised it was based on Linux and discovered the treasure trove of Maemo apps out there. Pretty soon I had a good application stack including some of my desktop favourites like Pidgin IM, OpenSSH etc. However the killer app for it turned out to be mplayer. I load up Divx and Xvid movies and tv programmes onto a 1GB RS-MMC and have the perfect mobile movie player for the car and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Of course there were problems too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The biggest by far was overall speed and performance. It&rsquo;s a very slow device to do anything.</li>
<li>The browser was pretty rubbish too, unable to handle any site with lots of Javascript and unable to handle modern Flash sites like YouTube.</li>
<li>I upgraded the OS on the N770 several times with OS2007HE with the expectation of better browser/flash performance but neither improved.</li>
<li>The build-in email client didn&rsquo;t work properly with GMail IMAP on Goog Apps and generally none of the built-in apps were as good as Open Source ones.</li>
<li>The lack of a java stack meant that it couldn&rsquo;t tap the huge application base from all the Nokia Symbian phones either.</li>
<li>The touch screen is almost unusable with fingers and really needs a stylus which is incredibly annoying when you want to tap something quickly.</li>
<li>The iGo Stowaway Bluetooth keyboard had major character repeat problems with it</li>
</ul>
<p>So I started wondering if maybe it was time to upgrade to the N800 or N810. The N800 has a much faster CPU, more memory, takes bigger memory cards, has a better screen, runs Skype, has a small camera and the all-new OS2008 but is over €200. The N810 adds a slide-out keyboard, GPS and a few other goodies and is generally over €300. However, I wasn&rsquo;t going to spend that sort of money without knowing for sure that these devices were far better.</p>
<p>Luckily Tom Raftery had an N810 which he thought was garbage compared to his iPod Touch and he loaned it to me for several weeks. I am so glad he did, I won&rsquo;t be buying it or the N800 based on my experiences.</p>
<p><a href="http://share.ovi.com/media/conor.public/conor.10225"><img src="http://media.share.ovi.com/m1/medium/0255/213f944c00074085b878bf73c5291817.jpg" alt="n810 - Share on Ovi">
</a></p>
<p>First the good news. It&rsquo;s much faster than the N770, the iGo keyboard works perfectly, the screen is much better, Flash works well, Skype works and the built-in keyboard is ok. But that&rsquo;s about it. The problem list is almost identical to the N770:</p>
<ul>
<li>You cannot practically use the UI without a stylus. The touchscreen remains terribly unresponsive. Palm had this issue sorted 8 years ago</li>
<li>You cannot call something an internet tablet if GMail doesn&rsquo;t work in normal HTML mode</li>
<li>You cannot call something an internet tablet if GMail IMAP doesn&rsquo;t work on your email client</li>
<li>Why have a movie player which is incapable of playing lots of formats when mplayer exists?</li>
<li>The GPS is utter rubbish compared to the N95-8GB. The maps are a joke.</li>
<li>The browser is still dog-slow with Javascript</li>
<li>There is still no java stack</li>
<li>No-one has bothered to write a Twitter client.</li>
<li>There is no built-in decent PIM app</li>
</ul>
<p>I just don&rsquo;t understand the target market for the N810. Give me an N95-8GB with a touch screen and the N-series tablets immediately become irrelevant. They do lots of things ok but nothing brilliantly, they just fall between several stools.</p>
<p>The sad fact is that the N770, a three year old design, is not that bad compared to N800/N810. Unless the next tablet is head and shoulders better than the iPod Touch it will be a flop. What would make me buy an N820? It has to be a cloud device:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seamless syncing with all Goog Apps and other online/cloud apps</li>
<li>Full integration with all the Ovi initiatives</li>
<li>Lightning fast JS engine</li>
<li>Brand new UI much more like the iPod Touch</li>
<li>Finger friendly UI</li>
<li>Java stack that can handle most J2ME apps built for mobile phones (Yes I&rsquo;ve read the technical problems with this. Solve them!)</li>
<li>Best of breed movie player, email client and online/offline PIM</li>
</ul>
<p>Somehow I doubt we&rsquo;re going to see this.</p>
