                <p>This is actually a combined review of O2 and Vodafone Ireland mobile broadband services since I tested them in parallel. Neither is a replacement for fixed-line BB but in certain situations, the O2 modem is extremely fast and was my winner overall.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve railed against both <a href="http://www.o2.ie/">O2</a> and <a href="http://www.vodafone.ie/">Voda </a>on repeated occasions for not offering decent value proper data plans on phones. I&rsquo;ve also read a wide variety of opinions on the various mobile broadband offferings with Three getting the most abuse. In order to find out for myself I signed up for both O2 and Voda&rsquo;s dongles on the same day.</p>
<p>They are both Huawei devices with the O2 one being the more modern E270. I believe the only major difference is that the E270 supports HSUPA (7.2 Mbs) out of the box but the Voda one has to be upgraded.</p>
<p>I ran a variety of tests over the two weeks of the Vodafone trial period (O2 offers 30 day trial). They both had pros and cons as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get 7.2Mbs on O2 in a variety of locations including parts of the Cork-Dublin train line</li>
<li>There are far fewer delays on O2 when doing streaming media like Qik</li>
<li>Both work well as a SIM in an N95-8GB phone</li>
<li>Throughput on O2 was better when I tested both using a co-located mast in Bandon Garda station</li>
<li>Bittorrent works on O2 :-)</li>
<li>I cannot get a HSDPA signal on O2 where I live in Bandon (but I can on Vodafone)</li>
<li>Both offer half price three month deals</li>
<li>Voda dongle is cheaper</li>
<li>O2 seems to have better coverage in general on Cork-Dublin line and can fall-back to EDGE speeds before falling further. However overall coverage on both is terrible on that line, particularly in North Tipperary</li>
<li>Both have patchy coverage in general and both suffer from congestion. I can get very high speeds in Bishopstown at 7.30am but quite poor speeds at 1pm in Emmet Place.</li>
<li>Remember that coverage stats are based on population not land area so large swathes of rural Ireland have no 3G let alone 3.5G</li>
<li>I happily sat in the Epicurean Foodhall in Dublin today with laptop connected at 7.2MBs and its performance was not that noticeably slower than many wifi hotspots I&rsquo;ve used</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end I chose the O2 modem due to the higher HSUPA speed in many urban settings and better throughput in most of my tests. The PC software is less clunky too. I returned the Vodafone dongle and got a full refund.</p>
<p>I recently did some bandwidth testing on the Cork-Dublin line using iperf on a laptop and GPS on the N95. Whenever I get around to merging the two datasets I&rsquo;ll publish the findings on Google Maps.</p>
