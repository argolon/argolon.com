                <p><a href="http://www.pix.ie/">Pix.ie</a> is often compared to Yahoo&rsquo;s Flickr and understandably so, but it offers a far more impressive and friendly user interface. Once they launch their public API, they should be unstoppable.</p>
<p>There are a LOT of photo sharing sites out there. It&rsquo;s an area I haven&rsquo;t dug too deeply into over the years as my needs are quite simple. I want somewhere that allows me to easily upload cameraphone pics and screenshots, set the privacy so that my family doesn&rsquo;t need an account to view them and allows me to display some of those pics in a variety of sizes on my blogs.</p>
<p>Up until recently, Flickr fit the bill perfectly but I&rsquo;ve always found its user interface to be unintuitive. Drop-down menus in 2008! However it won on speed, price and tools. The various Flickr uploaders really are very good. I&rsquo;ve also been a fan of Shozu on my mobile phone for sending pics directly to Flickr. Most recently I found that the maps showing geo-located pics taken with GPS in my N95 was an absolute killer feature.</p>
<p>In the past few months I&rsquo;ve been using Twango/Ovi more. There are a couple of reasons for this - better N95 integration and decent video upload. Downsides were less flexible photo sizing, poor mapping and an annoying Java Applet based uploader.</p>
<p>Pix.ie doesn&rsquo;t openly address this ultra-early-adopter market but it easily competes with Flickr on mainstream user features whilst doing it in a much slicker way and the site is infinitely more usable than the horror that is Photobox.</p>
<p><a href="http://pix.ie/conor/616069"><img src="http://photos2.pix.ie/4D/B9/4DB99DDEF54C4931B1843E105927184D-500.jpg" alt="pixie">
</a></p>
<p>Having played with it a lot today, I really don&rsquo;t know why I didn&rsquo;t move to it sooner for a lot of the stuff I do. Rest assured that all Web2Ireland.org pics will reside there from now on. Marcus Mac Innes has promised us a Wordpress plug-in too which will provide a sidebar gallery feature like the FlickrRSS one we currently use.</p>
<p>What would I like to see? Well I know the API is coming so that&rsquo;s great. The RSS feeds are excellent but maybe one per album too? I was just about to suggest a &ldquo;secret&rdquo; email address but that&rsquo;s there too so I&rsquo;ve added it to Shozu and I&rsquo;m now uploading pictures directly from my N95-8GB. So in fact &ldquo;location&rdquo; is really the only thing missing at all!</p>
<p>Whilst Pix.ie gets quite a bit of notice in the press generally, I&rsquo;m not sure people realise just how powerful it is. It can compete with the best sites globally, is a damn sight prettier than most of them and is the easiest photo-sharing site to use that I&rsquo;ve found so far.</p>
