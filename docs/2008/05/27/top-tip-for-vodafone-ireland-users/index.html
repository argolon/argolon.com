                <p>So we&rsquo;ve all heard the horror stories of people going abroad and using the data connection on the phone and being charged €5k by Vodafone.</p>
<p>I was in the UK twice recently and on the first occasion had to make a quick data connection so Nokia Maps could figure out where I was. Of course I was then petrified that the 200KB would end up costing €100. However, when I checked my bill online, it showed the connection alright but the charge was zero!</p>
<p>When I was back again last week, I grabbed a ton of mail, twitter messages etc and then checked the bill a few days later. Again, zero charge.</p>
<p>It looks like there are no roaming data charges in UK if [a] you use the shitty Vodafone Live access point [b] you only connect on Vodafone UK [c] you have the 500MB &ldquo;hamstrung web data&rdquo; bundle.</p>
<p>The thing is, I don&rsquo;t know if this is policy or a mistake. Voda&rsquo;s estimates of my data usage each month are usually a factor of 10 too small so it may just be that the metering system they are using (4 macaws with abacuses) is just screwed up at the minute.</p>
<p>If you want to take the chance, you&rsquo;ll save yourself a bunch of money on wifi charges or roaming data charges. Note that this only works when accessing the web on the phone itself. Voda Live, because it isn&rsquo;t a proper APN, cannot be used when you are using your phone as a modem for your laptop. It also cannot be used by your mobile broadband dongle.</p>
<p>Oh and switch to &ldquo;manual network selection&rdquo; when abroad since the phone roamed to O2-UK for a short while in the Tube when it couldn&rsquo;t find a Vodafone signal. I&rsquo;m pretty sure that will cost you big-time if you connect.</p>
