            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Here&rsquo;s a few quick ones off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cubic Telecom will have a £100m exit</li>
<li>European Founders, Howzat Media, TAG or Advent will do a deal with a web or mobile start-up here</li>
<li>More foreign VCs will invest in Irish web start-ups than Irish VCs</li>
<li>One of the current batch of Irish Web 2.0 start-ups will go global in a big way</li>
<li>EI&rsquo;s €170m VC fund will continue to provide minimal benefits to Irish web start-ups</li>
<li>Eircom&rsquo;s small fund will result in two major web start-up successes</li>
<li>Someone will launch a full Y Combinator/Seedcamp here</li>
<li>Minister John McGuinness will be given responsibility for re-structuring all state bodies concerned with business</li>
<li>EI will absorb Údarás na Gaeltachta</li>
<li>EI will launch a self-contained web unit with its own budget, minimal red-tape, firewall access to Facebook and based in the Cork Gaeltacht or Kilkenny</li>
<li>Damien Mulley will launch his own start-up</li>
<li>Six Apart will launch a free version of Typepad</li>
<li>Six Apart or Automattic will launch a full blown social network built on their blogging platforms</li>
<li>Facebook Sign-to-Noise will continue to plummet as more and more people join and repeat usage plateaus (How many FB apps did I have to install this week just to read happy new year messages?)</li>
<li>There will be a management bloodbath at a high level in the mobile operators as they see ARPU drop on traditional services and continue to sit idly-by, unable to make sense of the mobile internet</li>
<li>Google&rsquo;s Mobile strategy will continue to peek out here and there and continue scare the bejesus out of the incumbents</li>
<li>The first Google Android phone will be launched by HTC and won&rsquo;t be fantastic</li>
<li>Amazon will merge with eBay</li>
<li>Amazon will seriously impact Apple iTunes</li>
<li>Google will buy 3 (ok ok that&rsquo;s wishlist too)</li>
<li>RyanAir will buy 3 :-)</li>
<li>Ye know I cannot come up with one decent prediction about Microsoft. More of the same maybe?</li>
<li>The BBC will brand the OLPC XO as the BBC Micro Model D and launch a major combined TV and internet education program around it</li>
<li>Google will buy Bebo</li>
<li>One of the video 2.0  companies will be massive (Qik, Seesmic, Kyte, Ustream etc)</li>
<li>A dedicated generic Irish Social Network will be launched</li>
<li>Bandon and Old Chapel will get 12 Mbs broadband (that&rsquo;s on the fantasy list)</li>
<li>Old Chapel residents will get flat-rate unencumbered 3.5G on our phones (ditto)</li>
<li>2008 will provide tougher challenges but greater rewards to Irish entrepreneurs than 2007</li>
</ul>
<p>More as I think of them!</p>
