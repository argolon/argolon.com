                <p>A recurring conversation I have had recently is around very small non-technical Irish businesses having a web presence. I do a lot of Tech-Checks for the Cork CEBs and I continue to be surprised by how many of these businesses are invisible online.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for this may be that companies still think it costs a lot of money to have a web-site and non eircom.net email addresses. And there are still gougers out there charging people €2k for a simple off-the-shelf brochure site with stock graphics.</p>
<p>Jim Flynn of <a href="http://www.mts-consult.com">MTS Consulting</a> in Innishannon is a perfect example of someone who realised that his business could be helped with a simple web-site, <a href="http://www.mts-consult.com/template1/template5.aspx?blogID=2">a basic blog</a>, his own email domain and a <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/mtstrainingandcoaching">LinkedIn</a> profile. For very little money he got his site built via one of the online broker sites like Elance/RentACoder/ODesk etc. He can now be found using the default method for a lot of people (Google!).</p>
<p>When the total investment in getting an online presence is now in the very low three figures, there is simply no argument for even the tiniest business not having a web-site.</p>
<p>If you are a little bit technical you could even do it for less as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get a .com domain with the cheapest hosting package at somewhere like <a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a> for $46 per year, giving you 5 GB Space, 500 Email Accounts, Forums, Blogging, Photos</li>
<li>Use an online service like <a href="http://www.synthasite.com/">Synthasite</a> to create a simple site very easily with info about what your company is and how to contact you</li>
<li>Upload that design to your webhost</li>
<li>Done!</li>
<li>Total cost = $46</li>
</ul>
