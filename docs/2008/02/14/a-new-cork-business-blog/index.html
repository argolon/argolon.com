<p>Just spotted that the <a href="http://www.yougetitback.com/">YouGetItBack</a> guys in Cork now<a href="http://www.yougetitback.com/blog/index.php"> have a blog</a>. It&rsquo;s all about the business of Lost and Found and whilst they only started on Monday, the posts are flying in.</p>
<p>I wrote about them on my personal blog <a href="http://conoroneill.com/2006/06/30/yougetitback-what-a-great-idea/">wayyy back</a> in June 2006 when I found out about their initial product/service. It was a great idea then and it still is now. Buy a sticker for your phone/iPod etc, register the sticker code, put sticker on item. If you lose item, chances are it&rsquo;ll be found by someone honest who rings the freephone number listed and then YouGetItBack put you both in touch.</p>
<p>The blog is exactly the kind of style I like with a very light touch and friendly attitude without the corporate press release feeling you get off so many in the past couple of years. Check out the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.yougetitback.com/blog/index.php/2008/02/13/phone-found-in-bag-of-spuds/">phone found in sack of spuds</a>&rdquo; story to see what I mean</p>
