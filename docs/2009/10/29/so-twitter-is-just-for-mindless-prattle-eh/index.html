                <p>Every so often, Twitter surprises me. When you think you&rsquo;ve had enough of the consultants, snake oil salesmen, link baiters and spammers, someone uses it to blow your socks off with great customer service. Drugstore.com just did that for me.</p>
<p>I make maybe two large orders a year from <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/">drugstore.com</a> which is based in the US (and owned by Amazon I think). The main purchase is a generic OTC medicine which costs a ridiculous fortune in Ireland in branded form. But I also stock up on ibuprofen etc. Buying 250 of those for the same price as 24 in Ireland is all you need to know about the rip-off that this country remains.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, running out of that OTC med, I put in another order. Something went wrong in their system and the order was never processed. So I attempted to do it again late last week. Suddenly my standard purchases were all coming up as &ldquo;cannot deliver outside of USA&rdquo;. I exploded. My meds were now run out, I was in deep discomfort and now I was stymied. So I lashed out on Twitter with some pretty (ok very) harsh language about them.</p>
<p>Within a few hours I got a message from one of their representatives on Twitter, asking if they could help. I explained the situation but assumed it was a dead-end and that their shipping policies had changed (or some Irish muppet civil servant had changed the rules here).</p>
<p>So imagine my total delight to receive an email this evening from them apologising profusely and explaining that it was a bug/error and should not have happened. I can now happily re-do my order.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s now a given that all companies should be monitoring their brand on Twitter but apart from small-medium companies who are already known to me, I&rsquo;ve never had a major business  reach out to me like this. In fact I have purposely baited some Irish companies and they have studiously ignored me.</p>
<p>Now that my problem is sorted, I wholeheartedly recommend that you use drugstore.com to order from Ireland. Yes, the delivery/customs charges will initially shock you but it&rsquo;s still cheaper than here and the trick is to order lots and lots (or buy for your family/friends too). They add Irish Customs charges at source so you won&rsquo;t be gouged when the stuff arrives here.</p>
<p>Bravo <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/">drugstore.com</a>, I hope we all learn to run our businesses like you.</p>
