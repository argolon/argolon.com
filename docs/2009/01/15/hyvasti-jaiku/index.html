<p>I know a lot of webapp businesses are bought by Google and die through lack of attention. In our innocence, many of us thought Jaiku would be different. We thought there was a masterplan. We thought Jaiku would be the heart of the Android Address Book. The ultimate mobile social network with millions of users instantly.</p>
<p>We were completely and utterly wrong. Jaiku was bought to get some amazing minds, like Jyri. There is no masterplan. Google still doesn&rsquo;t get Social Networks. Will it ever?</p>
<p>And anyone who thinks that OpenSourcing the Jaiku code will achieve anything is sadly living in lala-land.  The software is irrelevant in a Social Network, the people are what matters.</p>
<p>But pleaseeeeeeee Twitter, give us channels, pleeeeeeeease. I&rsquo;ve avoided Saturday sport on TV for decades but I can&rsquo;t avoid it on Twitter.</p>
