We were chuffed to bits and tickled pink this morning to see that David Lenehan has done [an article about Irish webapps](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/top_irish_web_apps.php) on the very highly regarded Read/WriteWeb site and we got a mention!

Thanks guys.

He also profiled some of the older guys like [Pigsback](http://www.pigsback.com/) and newer ones like [Pixenate](http://www.pixenate.com/), [Putplace](http://www.putplace.com) and [Nooked](http://www.nooked.com/) and not forgetting [PollDaddy](http://www.polldaddy.com/) itself.

If you liked what David had to say, maybe consider [voting for it over at Digg](http://digg.com/tech_news/Top_Irish_Web_Apps_on_Read_WriteWeb)?
