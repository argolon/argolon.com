Given the interest expressed in having a [SeedCamp](http://seedcamp.com/) prep session, Gordon Murray has arranged  a room in Oriel House Hotel in Ballincollig, Cork for Thursday August 7th starting at 9am.

It will be quite informal, the aim is to get practical advice from each other on answering some of the questions on the application form so that you promote your business or idea as best as possible.

He’ll have printouts of the questions with him on the day. For anyone who’d like to work on it beforehand, here's a link to the the [Seedcamp application PDF](http://seedcamp.com/Seedcamp-app_and_guidelines_2008.pdf).

Some [further information about the Oriel house location](http://www.ewritecork.com/blog/2008/07/oriel-house-booked-for-seedcorn-application-brainstorming/) over on his blog.




Unfortunately the closing date for doing video pitches is Wednesday but hopefully that won’t stop people giving the webcam a go. Robin Blandford of Decisions for Heroes [already has](http://blog.seedcamp.com/2008/07/quick-pitch-round-table.html#comment-1072433).
