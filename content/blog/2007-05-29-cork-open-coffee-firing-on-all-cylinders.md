The recent coverage of Cork OCC on national radio gave the expected boost to attendance and we had more than 15 coffee drinkers last Friday. More importantly the mix is heading in the right direction with entrepreneurs, the interested, investors, a PR guy, a corporate events guy and techies all there and all networking. 

I had a ton of people I wanted to talk to and didn't get to everyone. I did manage to have good conversations with Michael who is looking into doing local tech investments, Jan from the wonderful Touristr, Michael Tangeman from the Pen Group PR in Miami and Larry who is working on some really interesting ideas.

I wish I'd had a chance to talk more to Dennis and Ray about their plan to move their very specialised mature PC products onto the web. From the short chat we had, it makes total sense.

Pat had us all engrossed with his description of their upcoming product. It screams killer telecoms app. I was also thrilled to hear that their funding was raised locally.

I just wish we'd had another hour there.

The first International OCC meet is on this Thursday in Amsterdam. I'm arriving a bit late but should hopefully catch a good chunk of it. See you there.
