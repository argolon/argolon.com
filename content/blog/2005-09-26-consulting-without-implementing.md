There is [an interview over on Steve Shu's Blog](http://steveshu.typepad.com/steve_shus_weblog/2005/09/qa_with_deloitt.html) with Mike McLaughlin, a Management Consultant from Deloitte. Whilst the bulk of the interview is targetted at MBA students, there is one very telling comment about  executable strategies rather than credenza-ware. Surprisingly, there are still many large Consultancies out there with no delivery capability. They can guide you on an IT strategy but they have no ability to help you implement it. 

We believe there is a good opportunity for smaller companies such as ourselves to partner with some of the big guys to enable them to provide implementation services so that they can present themselves as more of a one-stop-shop whilst not losing focus on their own core competencies.
