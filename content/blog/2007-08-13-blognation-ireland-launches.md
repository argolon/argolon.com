I'm still buzzing over the fact that the [blognation Ireland](http://ietech.blognation.com/) site has gone live. We've already made it to the front page of [Techmeme](http://techmeme.com/)!

As I said in [the opening post](http://ietech.blognation.com/2007/08/13/blognation-ireland-launches/):



<blockquote>
blognation Ireland launches today to bring you all the latest news from the world of Web2.0 and mobile in Ireland. 2007 is the year when activity in web development has been at its most exciting here in a long time. Our aim is to raise the visibility of this local activity to a much wider global audience.

The Irish site is part of the blognation network which is building up to be the biggest tech news site on non-US Web 2.0 startups around the globe including EMEA, Asia-Pacific, Latin America and Canada
