I've been trying in vain to sign up to the Live Clipboard mailing list using the details provided on many sites and blogs. All of them say to head over to discuss.microsoft.com but it looks like this server is gone (or at least it has been offline for quite a while). I did some ferreting around on the main Microsoft site and found some generic mailing list instructions from 1998. I was shocked when they worked for live-clip too.

Once I signed up via e-mail, I discovered the relevant site also has a web sign-up page. If you want to sign up, just head over to [DISCUSSMS]( http://discussms.hosting.lsoft.com).
