The noise about spamminess of emails has obscured the fact that this is an important launch. As an alpha it is rough around the edges and sxip login is broken. I'll do a full post later when I have had time to play more. Big congrats to Marc and all the team. It looks like there is a bunch of stuff here which will help us build something very complementary.
