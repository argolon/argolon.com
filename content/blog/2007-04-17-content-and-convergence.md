Haydn has offered up some quite controversial opinions on where many Irish web companies should put their energies and also what the BarCampDublin focus should be. It's something I'd like to see argued from both points of view so please [head over to Mediangler](http://www.mediangler.com/2007/04/16/bar-camp-dublin-needs-to-focus-on-content/) and offer your thoughts.
