And that my schoolboy French improves in the meantime. Certain impending new arrivals will dictate whether I can go to [the event formerly known as Les Blogs](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2006/10/les_blogs_3_reg.html)  or not but it does sound like it'll be a fantastic two days.

I'm sure [Tom](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/) is going and [Mark has said that he is](http://www.2igtv.com/blipverts/2006/10/le_web_3.html). Anyone else thinking of it?

[Kieran Murphy has some top foodie tips](http://www.icecreamireland.com/2006/10/28/food-treats-in-paris-my-best-of/) from his recent trip to Paris. Casa Olympe may be getting a visit from me along with [Patrick Roger](http://www.patrickroger.com/site/index.html?flashVersion=8&langue=en&adr=4)'s chocolate shop.
