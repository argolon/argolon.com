Jon William Toigo over at Byte & Switch[ has a great article on Aperi](http://www.byteandswitch.com/document.asp?doc_id=83506&WT.svl=tease1) and the history of SRM in general. His analysis of industry reaction to the Aperi announcement by IBM is particularly incisive.

Whether IBM will succeed (with the help of the OpenSource community) or not is obviously the great unknown. In any other sector the chances would be good but so many initiatives in this area have started with grand hopes and ended up as yet another niche product optimised for a small set of specific hardware. We'll obviously know more when it moves from the realm of vapourware and we can start looking at the architecture of system.
