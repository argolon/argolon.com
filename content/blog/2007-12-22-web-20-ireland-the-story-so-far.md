A little storm erupted this morning over the TechLudd initiative which was launched by some of those who went on the Paddy’s Valley trip to the USA. Paul Walsh from Segala [considers it misguided](http://segala.com/blog/why-techludd-should-stop-before-it-starts) and wonders why no attempt was made to reach out to existing networks in Ireland, particularly considering TechLudd is supposed to be about networking. I offered my few cents in support of Paul’s position and some decent debate ensued in the comments.

Fergus Burns posted a comment which I consider incredibly important to the web community and I quote it below. I encourage you to offer your own opinions on the Segala post.

On a sidenote, I just did a theme change on the [Web2Ireland](https://web2ireland.org/) site and imported all my old blognation posts there. It would be fantastic if some designer in the Irish web community would do a custom design and logo for the site. It has a large number of RSS subscribers and many highly influential people visit it regularly. It would be a great calling card for your design abilities.

Fergus on Web2Ireland and the community here:

* Web2Ireland is for everyone - its not me, nooked - its about the community
* it was setup @ web2con in SF in 2005
* its audience is widespread - you would be surprised who’s subscribed
* web2ireland is a brand that people relate to [esp. outside of Ireland]
* EI provide no support to the forum - although its all about startups/web companies in Ireland [32 counties]
* I personally pay for the domain reg.
* Hosting365 provide hosting for free
* we ran one large conf in 2006 - which EI stage managed
* Web2Ireland only works because people like Conor, Paul, Sean, Jonathan, Julian and a host of others contribute
* we also try to stimulate activity - seedcamp, opencoffee, barcamp, etc - not in the business of “approving stuff”
* we tried our best to get EI to do a israelwebtour - instead people stepped up and PV happened
* Demobar was based on Stirr model in Valley
* Ryan/FOWA presented a great opp to make the 1st event successful
* Sean O’Sullivan made DemoBar I happen
* the next demobar was pencilled in for end of Jan [the date was based on a keynote speaker availability and working with Ireland Inc dinner, etc - hence how Paul and I ended up talking about events in Jan]
* We have sponsors already - instead of us going with a begging bowl, we actually have people coming to us. [and some of these sponsors contacted me in relation to techludd - confusion as you can imagine]
* At the end of the day the question is - do you want a vibrant community @ web2 in Ireland or do you want a host of little groups doing their own thing.
* An example of how it can work from [Ryan Carson](http://futureofwebapps.wordpress.com/2007/09/18/dublin-paris-and-amsterdam): “The scene in Dublin is very, very exciting. So much so that I’d venture to say that it’s even more happening than the London scene. We had a massive turnout (200 excited people), there were demos, tons of networking - it felt even more exciting than a TechCrunch party in Silicon Valley. I’d say a big key to that is the Web2Ireland group. They’re very positive, outgoing and excited about succeeding in the web space.”
* An example of it not working was MashupCamp - that was not good - Damien posted what everybody felt was wrong.
* In summary its all about a successful ecosystem - we’re struggling to create one - and I question if we’ll ever have one.
* Its not about who does what - its about who does what for everyone - and creating success for a everyone

As usual Fergus is 100% on the money.
