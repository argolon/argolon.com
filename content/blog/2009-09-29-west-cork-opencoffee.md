I founded [Cork OpenCoffee](http://www.corkopencoffee.org/) back in early 2007 and I'm delighted to see it grow to be the most successful OCC in Ireland. The bulk of the organising is now done by Gordon Murray of [Murrion Software](http://www.murrion.ie/) and Ciara Crossan of [Weddingdates](http://www.weddingdates.ie/).

A few months back [OpenCoffee Mallow](http://opencoffeemallow.wordpress.com/) launched and by all accounts is going really well. Their next meet-up is in Springfort Hall, on Tuesday the 6th of October, from 10 am until approx 12Â pm.

I'm thrilled that Cork now has its third OpenCoffee as befits a county of its size, layout, distributed population and entrepreneurial spirit. [West Cork OpenCoffee](http://www.westcorkopencoffee.com/) meets in the Celtic Ross Hotel in Rosscarbery. The next event is tomorrow at 12.30. All are welcome and if you haven't attended an OCC before, you'll find a friendly group of entrepreneurs, freelancers and technology people who network on an informal basis over a cup of coffee.
