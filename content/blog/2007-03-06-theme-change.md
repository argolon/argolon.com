I'm testing out Scott Allan Wallick's [blog.txt](http://www.plaintxt.org/themes/blogtxt/) theme. I'm a huge fan of Sandbox and this is very impressive too. Minimalist but attractive. It is also highly configurable and has lots of hAtom and hCard goodness built-in. I prefer it to the old one we had here. Thoughts anyone?
