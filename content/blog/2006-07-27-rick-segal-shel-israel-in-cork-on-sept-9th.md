[Tom Raftery has posted](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/rick-and-shel-want-to-meet-you/) that [Rick Segal](http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/) & [Shel Israel](http://redcouch.typepad.com/) are visiting Cork on Sept 9th as part of their world tour. 

They are having a meet-up in Taste of Thailand and would love to talk to people with great ideas who can help them see how tech entrepreneurialism will evolve in Ireland over the next few years. They are also available to meet earlier in the day but will shoot anyone who appears with a powerpoint. Check out Tom's post or [Pat Phelan's](http://blog.roam4free.ie/venture-capital/) for more details.

Rick is a very well known VC and Shel's book with Robert Scoble is obviously famous. Shel [also gave a great talk](https://argolon.com/2006/06/10/itcork-web20-conference-shel-israel/) at the [Web 2.0 mini-conference](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/web-20-conference-in-cork-attracts-international-speakers/) in Cork recently. I'm looking forward to meeting them both.
