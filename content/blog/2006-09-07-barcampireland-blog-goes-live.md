[Damien ](http://www.mulley.net)has just sent out a press release on [BarCampIreland ](http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland)so we expect the numbers to swell considerably over the next few days. [Walter ](http://www.sxoop.com)has done a lovely job on cleaning up the [Wiki ](http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland)where all the main information about the event can be found. I've just opened up the [Official Blog](http://argolon.com/BarCampIreland/blog) where you can find all the news and buzz about the day. The Press Release is up there too for your comments and feedback.
