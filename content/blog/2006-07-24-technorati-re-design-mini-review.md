Technorati


  


    


      ★★★★☆ Just a quick mini-review: First off, I'm a huge fan of Technorati and love nearly everything they do. Secondly, I think uncluttered web pages should be mandatory. But despite this I'm just not sure about the re-design. It doesn't look finished (or something), maybe it is the excess of whitespace. More importantly, it only lists one blog for me on the front page but shows all of them when I drill down. But I do think they are on the right track for going mainstream i.e. KISS. More as I poke and prod.
    




UPDATE 1: Definite oddness going on. Do usual vanity search on "Conor O'Neill" and get my personal blog. Search on "Argolon" and still only get my personal blog. But go to front page and it only lists "Argolon" as beloging to me. Then go to "your Blogs" and both are happily listed. Day 1 glitches I guess




UPDATE 2: I imported a bunch of OPML and suddenly I have a richly populated homepage and both my blogs are listed. Curious but the whole thing looks a lot better now.
