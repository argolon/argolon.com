Wow that was some morning in Luigi Malone's! I'd never been there before and the venue was just perfect. I arrived in to find a few of the guys along with Don the owner who stayed for the entire session. A huge thanks to Don for covering the cost of the refreshments today and for getting Wifi installed with almost no notice.

We had 20+ people turn up with the exact mix I was hoping for:



* Start-ups like [Pixenate](http://www.pixenate.com/), [Roam4Free](http://www.roam4free.ie/) and [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/)
* consultants like [Aonach](http://aonach.com/)
* some pure techies
* a bunch of budding entrepreneurs
* a development advisor from Enterprise Ireland
* Eileen from [CorkBIC](http://www.corkbic.com/html/default.htm) (Business Innovation Centre)
* Peter from CorkBIC [Business Angel Partnership](https://www.businessangels.ie/)
* an industrial liaison officer from UCC
* two ex-Motorola people
* and several people who (rightly) came along to see what it was all about


Given that it was the inaugural meeting, I said a few words, got everyone to introduce themselves and mentioned the [ShareIT](http://businessadvisory.ie/2007/03/15/press-release-shareit-initiative-launched/) initiative, some thoughts on Coworking and a desire to get more people from the investment community involved over time.

Of course OpenCoffee here is being driven by the opposite group to [the original one in the UK](http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/03/second-opencoffee-club-keeps-buzzing.html). Over there it is the VCs and Angels pushing it forward, over here it is the guys in start-ups. I did invite one VC but he prefers to wait and see that OpenCoffee has some legs first, which I do understand. It'll take time for the community to grow and for the reputation to spread. I'd love it (or whatever it becomes) to be a place where opportunities are found, networks are built and people have a social outlet in a business context.

Richard (who is building something in a similar space to ourselves) made the very interesting point that his community has always been a virtual one with his peers in the US, he simply wasn't aware so much was happening in Cork. I hope more and more local entrepreneurs hear about us and turn up for a great cup of coffee and some start-up banter on Friday March 30th. And if you are just curious about the whole thing, head on down, we're a friendly bunch and we won't talk about Twitter too much :-)

Several people requested a separate info page for OpenCoffee Cork so I'll set something up next week and announce it here.

UPDATE 1: [Saul has a list](http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/03/opencoffee-keeps-growing.html) of all the recent OpenCoffee Clubs around the world. Damned impressive!
