The first [ShareIT](http://businessadvisory.ie/) session was held [yesterday in UCC](http://www.mulley.net/2007/03/25/shareit-followup-thanks-to-all-the-speakers/). Unfortunately I had to leave early but I did catch [Jenny Kent's](http://www.clearcommunication.ie/) and [Krishna De's](http://www.krishnade.com/blog/) presentations both of which were excellent and full of practical nuggets rather than generalities. This is a genuinely valuable initiative for those starting out in tech businesses. I highly recommend attending the next one in Dublin on April 28th in the Microsoft offices.

My presentation on "Oursourcing - A Guide" is [here as a PDF](https://argolon.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/shareit_presentation_20070324a.pdf).
