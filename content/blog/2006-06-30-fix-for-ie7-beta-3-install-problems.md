I finally succumbed and installed the latest beta of IE7 to check out the RSS features, or at least I tried to. Six attempts and no joy. I tried everything and more in their troubleshooting document. I went on to the support site and there was a link to the IE newsgroup. And within two minutes I had the solution! 

So much for TechnoGoogleYahooBlogosphericRati, good old 1980's NNTP News got me the answer.

In case you run into the same problem, don't worry about any of that Registry editing, just download the installer, reboot into Safe Mode with Networking and do the install from there, reboot again. Problem solved.

First impressions? 



* Very similar to Firefox
* For some bizarre reason the menu bar is below the address bar
* Are they running Cleartype now or is that a Vista feature because the font rendering is fabulous?
* Bye Bye Maxthon for all my non-Firefox browsing I think.
