Just a quick mention of a neat new app that launched recently called [LifeSux daily](http://lifesuxdaily.com). It was developed by the same guy who now does all the heavy lifting on LouderVoice. It is another example of high speed development using Python and Django like the recently launched [Matt](http://www.themattinator.com/).

The ideas is simple:


<blockquote>Have you ever noticed that sometimes life really sux !? - Well, life really does have some serious hitches from time to time...

We designed LifeSuxDaily.com to let you share, with the community, those situations when you start feeling that life is a bitch and let you die ;) and get its feedback through comments and votes.

LifeSuxDaily.com is a user-powered community site. Users submit their stories, drive them through the moderation process and, once published, comment and vote on them.</blockquote>
