CorkBIC have arranged a briefing session on BES/SCS next Monday too. Whilst the Rubicon session is specifically targetted at start-ups, this one is more for the wider business community.

Short presentations will be made by:

Kevin Kenny, Tax Partner, Ernst & Young
Clare Creamer, Assistant Principal, Revenue Commissioners
Gerry O’Brien, Enterprise Ireland

Monday 12th November at 4pm – 5.15pm (to be followed by drinks reception) in the Clarion Hotel, Cork

RSVP  before 12 noon Thursday 8th November to Sandra Tortel, CorkBIC stortel AT corkbic DOT com or +353 21 230 7003 (places limited)

The pair of sessions are highly complementary and I aim to attend both.
