Once again we link over to the [EDS "Next Big thing Blog"](http://eds.com/sites/cs/blogs/eds_next_big_thing_blog/archive/2005/08/22/8084.aspx). This recent posting summarizes perfectly many of the customer issues involved in outsourcing. 

Over 13 years, in various companies, we have been involved in Outsourcing, Design Services, Consultancy and Professional Services and I don't think we have encountered many customers who would have analysed all of the issues mentioned in the EDS list. Generally we have found that for most it boils down to:

[1] We don't have the skills internally - outsource
[2] We are understaffed - outsource
[3] It's cheaper - outsource.

By doing a full and detailed analysis of each of the points brought up by the EDS posting, a customer can go a long way to avoiding disappointment in an outsourcing engagement.
