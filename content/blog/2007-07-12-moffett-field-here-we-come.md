[Paddy's Valley](http://paddysvalley.org/) has a definite date and [now a hotel](http://paddysvalley.org/?p=10). And soon maybe even [a t-shirt](http://jaiku.com/channel/paddysvalley). We'll set a closing date for signing up soon and spaces are limited so I encourage you to do so today!

If you know anyone in the Valley who you think would like to meet a bunch of Irish start-ups and techies, please contact them and let them know the details. If they bite, let us know too.

For those of you who don't know what [Moffett Field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moffett_Federal_Airfield) is, suffice to say when I did the tour of [NASA Ames](http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/home/index.html) many years ago, I touched an Apollo capsule, a Harrier Jump Jet and a Black Hawk Helicopter in Moffett Field. An engineer's nirvana.
