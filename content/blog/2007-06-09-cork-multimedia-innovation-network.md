UPDATE 2: This is now on this Thursday evening (5th July), from 5pm to 8pm. Details can be found at [Multimedia Innovation Network](http://min.ucc.ie/)

UPDATE: This has been postponed until some time in July so please ignore the date listed below.

I was talking to Dave Murphy from UCC at yesterday's Open Coffee and he mentioned the Cork Multimedia Innovation Network. They are having their first event in UCC next Wednesday, June 13th. The Network is a joint effort between The Technology Transfer Initiative and the Computer Science Department in UCC.



<blockquote>
UCC is embarking on this innovative initiative in response to the growing number of multimedia companies in the area. The aims of the network are to promote Cork as a centre of excellence in multimedia, to promote research and collaboration between UCC and the Multimedia Industry and also to establish connections in the Multimedia sector. There is no cost involved in membership and it is hoped to run a number of events of interest to the sector over the year.
</blockquote>



This first event has speakers from UCC and the keynote speaker is Anil Kokraham, Senior Lecturer & Fellow of Trinity College, Dublin. Anil is an extremely established and renowned academic and was the 2006 recipient of a technical Oscar by the American Motion Picture Academy for his development of visual effects software for films.

Contact Linda McCourt (l.mccourt AT ucc DOT ie) who is the Project Executive at the Technology Transfer Initiative if you would like to attend.
