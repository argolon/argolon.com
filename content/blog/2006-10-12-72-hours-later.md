The eircom donkeys finally figure out how their own equipment works and re-enable BT customers. This is more than 12 hours after they re-enabled their own customers. We now have broadband again. Does BT have an SLA with eircom? A charge of something like Ã¢â€šÂ¬100 per customer per hour of downtime seems reasonable to me. 

When O2 launch HSDPA (soon?), their ads should simply state three things - "We use no part of the eircom network to deliver wireless broadband to you", "we actually give a damn", "there is no chance of us going bust". The first one will be good enough for me. I'll sign up the day they launch.

UPDATE 1: Nope, it's gone down again. These people shouldn't be allowed run a sweetshop let alone a telco.
