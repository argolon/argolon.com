The [it@cork annual conference](http://www.itcork.ie/index.cfm/page/conference) has just been announced. Its title is "GREEN IT: Reduce CO2, Raise Profits" and it's on November 26 in the lovely Radisson SAS Hotel in Cork.

The line-up looks like an excellent mix with the focus being clearly on Green as it relates to IT and Business. I particularly like the profit angle given the turmoil the world is going through right now
