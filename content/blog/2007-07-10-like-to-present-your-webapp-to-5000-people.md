Web 2.0 Expo is [coming to Berlin](http://berlin.web2expo.com/) from 5th-8th November and it is a serious opportunity for those involved in web development in Ireland to get noticed.

Jennifer Pahlka, one of the organisers, is coming to Cork on July 14th and Tom Raftery has arranged an [OpenDrinks Event](http://opendrinks.pbwiki.com/) that evening for any Irish people interested in going to the Web 2.0 Expo or, more importantly, for anyone hoping to present there.

[Tom has all the details](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/opendrinks-cork-and-web-20-expo/). Note that this is the only Irish stop-off for Jen. You'd be nuts to pass up on this opportunity. If you aren't going, tell your buddies to.
