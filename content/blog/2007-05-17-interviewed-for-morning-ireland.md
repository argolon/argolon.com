I did a short interview with Emma McNamara this afternoon for Radio 1. The overall theme of her piece was "The Economy" and as with other items in the series they took a regional focus which was Cork/Munster on this occasion.

I talked for far too long about the start-up scene down here, [Open Coffee](http://opencoffee.ning.com/), [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/), [PaddysValley](http://paddysvalley.org), the Ireland=Romania [state of Venture Capital here](http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10010057.shtml) and the difficulty many have in getting access to capital. I hope I gave a balance of positives and negatives and gave some useful suggestions.

The segment is on at around 7.50am Friday on RTE Radio 1. It'll be about 4 minutes long with multiple contributors. You can also listen to the [live stream here](http://www.rte.ie/radio/index.html).

UPDATE: For those of you who didn't hear it, they mainly included my mentions of OCC and the need to get Academia+Talent+Money together if we want to create anything like the Silicon Valley culture.  The show was heard by about 400k people and I was told by RTE that they had plenty of calls afterwards enquiring about OCC. I think Luigi's at 3pm on Friday is going to be busy!
