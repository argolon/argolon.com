The University of Limerick Computer Society, [Skynet](http://www.skynet.ie/), is celebrating its 15th anniversary and they are hosting a very impressive looking conference called [SkyCon](http://www.skycon.skynet.ie/index.php). I talked to Laura about it after BarCamp and it sounds like a cannot-miss event. Just look at the [list of Speakers](http://www.skycon.skynet.ie/speakers.php).

It's on in UL from Feb 16th to 18th and at the very least you should turn up for Alan Cox's session.
