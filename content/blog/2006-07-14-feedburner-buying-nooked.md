Well as ever it looks like Valleywag is about as accurate as the National Enquirer and I shouldn't be spreading their rubbish rumours. Fergus has stated that the story is untrue. It was just one of those stories that grows because it makes perfect sense even if it is not true.

<strike>Not that I'd ever believe a word on [Valleywag ](http://www.valleywag.com/tech/feedburner/scoop-feedburner-buys-nooked-187454.php)but they are reporting that [Feedburner ](http://www.feedburner.com/)has bought [Nooked](http://www.nooked.com/). If it's true then huge congrats to Fergus and the team, it is much deserved. And it proves that you can be located anywhere in the world and make a successful web company as long as it is based on a solid business idea. 

Whether the rumour is true or not, I do think they make a great fit with each other!
