I'm heading to Brighton tonight for the [dConstruct 2006](http://2006.dconstruct.org/) conference tomorrow. It really does look like it's going to be a great day. [Jeremy](http://adactio.com/) has done a superb job in building the buzz via his [podcasts](http://2006.dconstruct.org/podcast/). And I even got an indirect mention in one of them ("there are two guys travelling from Cork"). Possibly my first ever sort-of podcast reference. 

Jeremy is also doing a [microformats session over lunch](http://upcoming.org/event/104699/) which I will definitely be attending. I should be wearing the standard uniform of a "People's Republic of Cork" t-shirt if anyone wants to come over and have a chat. See you all in [Heist](http://upcoming.org/event/103713/) some time after 9pm tonight. Oh and if any BarCampLondon organisers or attendees are there, I'd love to pick your brains on things to watch out for as we organise [BarCampIreland](http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland).
