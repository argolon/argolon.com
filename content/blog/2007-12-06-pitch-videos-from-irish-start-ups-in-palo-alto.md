The Enterprise Ireland and InterTradeIreland VC Forum pitching event in Silicon Valley on Tuesday looks to have been a great event. Five Irish web start-ups pitched to a panel of local VCs and an invited audience. You can see all the videos over at the [Paddy's Valley blog](http://paddysvalley.org/). The really interesting part for me was the questions from the VCs. They have a very strong focus on competitive advantage. It's well worth your time watching all five.
