[IT@Cork](http://www.itcork.ie/) is a very active network of IT Professionals in the Cork area of Ireland. They hold regular talks, conferences and meetings and are a fantastic resource for the industry in this region. We have recently become members and look forward to meeting our peers at various events over the next few months. We will also be attending the Bloggers dinner after their [Annual Technology & Business Conference](http://www.itcork.ie/index.cfm?page=events&eventId=53) at which [Robert Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/07/04.html#a10543) will also be making an appearance. See you there.
