Just spotted that the [YouGetItBack](http://www.yougetitback.com/) guys in Cork now[ have a blog](http://www.yougetitback.com/blog/index.php). It's all about the business of Lost and Found and whilst they only started on Monday, the posts are flying in.

I wrote about them on my personal blog [wayyy back](http://conoroneill.com/2006/06/30/yougetitback-what-a-great-idea/) in June 2006 when I found out about their initial product/service. It was a great idea then and it still is now. Buy a sticker for your phone/iPod etc, register the sticker code, put sticker on item. If you lose item, chances are it'll be found by someone honest who rings the freephone number listed and then YouGetItBack put you both in touch.

The blog is exactly the kind of style I like with a very light touch and friendly attitude without the corporate press release feeling you get off so many in the past couple of years. Check out the "[phone found in sack of spuds](http://www.yougetitback.com/blog/index.php/2008/02/13/phone-found-in-bag-of-spuds/)" story to see what I mean
