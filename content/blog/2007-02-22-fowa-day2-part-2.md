Back at base now and didn't get a chance yesterday to write about some of the other speakers. Overall Day 1 was more impressive than Day 2. The Open Mic slot was poor overall but Phil's presentation was very entertaining. It was a pity he had so little time as I'm sure a Q&A; afterwards would have been very heated!

However we did have another highlight near the end with the guys from [MOO](http://www.moo.com). It wasn't just a good presentation, love for what they were doing just poured forth from them. I adore their product and my respect for them grows every day. I didn't manage to get over to Richard to take him up on his offer of 100 free cards. Damn.
 
I think Ryan managed to find something for everyone with FoWA London 2007, I left with a real buzz and re-energised for what we are doing. Some of the cute things like the "need investment" and "have investment" stickers were good fun and I'd like to see them at all conferences. The sambos weren't great but then the ticket price was very low and the location meant you had tons of alternatives to choose from. Everyone beat Ryan up about WiFi but his handling of it should be a lesson to other conference organisers, particularly French ones. Amazingly, BTOpenzone wasn't that bad and I managed to deploy [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/) site fixes during one of the less interesting talks!

Well done to Ryan, Gill and the team, you held an event to be proud of. I hope the workshops are going well today.
