[Damien has just announced](http://www.mulley.net/2007/02/13/business-advisory-group-share-it-free-training-for-startups/) the [Share IT](http://businessadvisory.ie/2007/02/12/the-share-it-programme/) Free Training sessions which he has organised under the umbrella of [BusinessAdvisory.ie](http://businessadvisory.ie). This is a fantastic idea where those with expertise in certain areas give training for free to those who are seeking it.

Initially it the focus is on IT/Technology but if it proves successful, I'm sure the scope will expand. I'm thrilled to be able to do my bit and share what little knowledge I have in a few areas on [the first training day in UCC on March 24th](http://businessadvisory.ie/2007/02/13/share-it-cork-saturday-march-24th/). Having worked for over 13 years in the Services and Outsourcing business and now making use of Outsourcing myself, I hope I can at least help people avoid all the mistakes I've made over the years.

If you are in a start-up or are thinking about setting one up, I think many of the sessions will be useful to you. Head on over to [BusinessAdvisory.ie](http://businessadvisory.ie/2007/02/13/share-it-cork-saturday-march-24th/) for all the details.
