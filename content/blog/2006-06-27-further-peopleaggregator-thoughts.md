I'm still here and still playing. Seems like the Irish contingent got here quickly so there are a few groupings of us already. More comments on features:

Hmm, I'm about to insert some inline HTML, will that work? 




  * For the life of me I cannot find the RSS feeds (neither can Livelines) even tho one person has stated where they are
  * Flickr now working - thanks to some helpful Paggregators (Paggers?). Use your email address, not your Flickr ID or Yahoo login
  * Whilst there are obviously Microformats in the Structured Blogging posts and Flocktails picked up my review of PeopleAggregator itself, it doesn't see a hCard on my public page. Does it exist?
  * No rich text editing controls in the blog posts. No loss really but it will keep the geek quotient high
  * What services are being pinged when we blog?
  * I did a review on PA itself but it forgot my OutputThis settings so it never appeared over at [Argolon](http://argolon.com/). You can [find it here](http://www.peopleaggregator.net/content.php?cid=1232)

  * Why does it time out and force me to re-login?
  * It would be nice if the permalinks and general navigation structure used my ID somewhere in the path
  * I assume a ton of different export features will come as the site heads towards full release



The thing that really works for me overall is that I am not a MySpace user or a Bebo User or an Orkut User. I'm a Flickr, Structured Blogging, Technorati, Wordpress, Google, sxore, del.icio.us, ma.gnolia, ClaimID user. If I can have one place which gives me Read/Write access to all of those services from one place and uses that information to enable and create intelligent links and relationships to other users like a LinkedIn on steroids, then I'll never leave.
