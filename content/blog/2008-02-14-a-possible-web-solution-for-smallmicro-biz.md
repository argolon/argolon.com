We had a great exchange of ideas on [the previous post](https://argolon.com/2008/02/08/irish-smallmicro-businesses-and-the-web/) about ways of getting very small businesses online. Of particular interest to me are the companies with zero technical ability who just need a solution which involves them typing in some information about their company and then they have a web-presence.

One solution for this type of business is [eWrite "Cork"](http://www.ewritecork.com/). Up until now the [eWrite](http://www.ewrite.ie/) guys, John and Gordon, have been focused more on the Small to Medium end of the market rather than the Micro to Small. With "Cork" they have put together an inexpensive package which will get you online with minimal effort and maximum handholding.

Their offering is well worth a look if you want to have a web presence but really don't know where to start. I'll try and do a full review of it along with the solutions discussed in the previous post in the coming weeks.
