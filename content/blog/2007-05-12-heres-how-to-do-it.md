Go, read Ben Barren's post on " [Who Will Fund Local Web 2.0 Aussie Businesses](http://benbarren.blogspot.com/2007/05/who-will-fund-local-web-20-aussie.html)?" and replace Australia everywhere with Ireland.

It's a simple formula, I believe it can work. 

Anything is better than where we are right now. When your VC activity is mentioned [in the same sentence as Romania](http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_10010057.shtml), you know you have a deep deep problem to solve.

A report on[ our visit to London Open Coffee](http://biztwozero.com/btz/2007/05/11/opencoffee-club-the-irish-have-landed/) coming later. I shouldn't business blog on my birthday.
