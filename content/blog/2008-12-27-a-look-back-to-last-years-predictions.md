My predictions for 2008 were very hit and miss (mainly miss), here's a quick re-cap:



* Cubic Telecom will have a £100m exit

	    * Not yet. 2008 was an amazing year for Pat and the team with deals happening at breakneck pace.


* European Founders, Howzat Media, TAG or Advent will do a deal with a web or mobile start-up here

	    * Again not yet. I still think this will happen


* More foreign VCs will invest in Irish web start-ups than Irish VCs

	    * Well they both hover around zero. With current climate, we could be waiting a long time for this.


* One of the current batch of Irish Web 2.0 start-ups will go global in a big way

	    * PollDaddy!


* EI’s €170m VC fund will continue to provide minimal benefits to Irish web start-ups

	    * I got that one 1000% correct


* Eircom’s small fund will result in two major web start-up successes

	    * Sadly not yet but the signs are still good


* Someone will launch a full Y Combinator/Seedcamp here

	    * Sadly no. And with Government pissing away another €500m to foreign VCs this time, could they not take a €5m flutter with some smart entrepreneurs (no not VCs!) co-managing this?


* Minister John McGuinness will be given responsibility for re-structuring all state bodies concerned with business

	    * Again no. Will Government have the balls to shake everything up in 2009? €500m to foreign VCs says no.


* EI will absorb Údarás na Gaeltachta

	    * No.


* EI will launch a self-contained web unit with its own budget, minimal red-tape, firewall access to Facebook and based in the Cork Gaeltacht or Kilkenny

	    * No, big opportunity missed. The geo-centric model of EI needs to change to centres of expertise.


* Damien Mulley will launch his own start-up

	    * Mulley Communications :-)


* Six Apart will launch a free version of Typepad

	    * No. Give it time tho.


* Six Apart or Automattic will launch a full blown social network built on their blogging platforms

	    * No. I'm very surprised how long this is taking.


* Facebook Sign-to-Noise will continue to plummet as more and more people join and repeat usage plateaus (How many FB apps did I have to install this week just to read happy new year messages?)

	    * SNR did plummet but usage didn't. I started to find FB more useful in the latter part of 2008 as all the vampire crap subsided.


* There will be a management bloodbath at a high level in the mobile operators as they see ARPU drop on traditional services and continue to sit idly-by, unable to make sense of the mobile internet

	    * No. Bit by bit it looks like the mobile telcos are getting the hang of the internet. 


* Google’s Mobile strategy will continue to peek out here and there and continue scare the bejesus out of the incumbents

	    * The strategy seems to be working well. The ones who are scared are not the telcos but Nokia and the non-Android handset makers. It looks like the mobile telcos are actually embracing Android.


* The first Google Android phone will be launched by HTC and won’t be fantastic

	    * I got this one right. I have a G1. The software is fantastic, the hardware mediocre. Review coming soon on LouderVoice.


* Amazon will merge with eBay

	    * No. They still should


* Amazon will seriously impact Apple iTunes

	    * I believe they are making a bigger and bigger dent here. Android will accelerate this.


* Google will buy 3 (ok ok that’s wishlist too)

	    * No, not even close.


* RyanAir will buy 3 ![:-)](https://www.argolon.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)


	    * Ditto.


* Ye know I cannot come up with one decent prediction about Microsoft. More of the same maybe?

	    * Live Mesh impresses the socks off me.


* The BBC will brand the OLPC XO as the BBC Micro Model D and launch a major combined TV and internet education program around it

	    * A little too bluesky for the BBC. Netbooks seem to have taken all the buzz here.


* Google will buy Bebo

	    * Well they were bought but not by Google.


* One of the video 2.0 companies will be massive (Qik, Seesmic, Kyte, Ustream etc)

	    * Whilst not massive, both Qik and Ustream seem to be doing very well.


* A dedicated generic Irish Social Network will be launched

	    * Both IGOpeople and Locle went live so I got that right!


* Bandon and Old Chapel will get 12 Mbs broadband (that’s on the fantasy list)

	    * We got 3 Mbs. Better than a poke in the eye I guess


* Old Chapel residents will get flat-rate unencumbered 3.5G on our phones (ditto)

	    * Well I got 1GB for €8 from Voda last month so we're heading in the right direction


* 2008 will provide tougher challenges but greater rewards to Irish entrepreneurs than 2007

	    * Yes, absolutely.
