I was disappointed to see that no Irish start-ups made it through to the initial 20 on [SeedCamp](http://seedcamp.com/). My gut tells me this is simply due to lack of applications. I only knew of one start-up here that applied. Did you? As the old ad goes "if you're not in, you can't win".

Maybe when they see the great outcome for the winners of the first one, we'll have more youngfellas and youngwans getting up of their bums and giving it a go.

[TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/08/30/seedcamp-finalists-chosen-battle-to-final-five-next-week/) and [Mashable](http://mashable.com/2007/08/30/seedcamps-20-startups-revealed/) have covered the first 20. Imagine, you could have had those hundreds of thousands of readers learning all about you.
 
Looking forward to seeing who makes the final 5 and then who gets the â‚¬50k.

p.s. you are applying to to [SeedCorn](http://seedcorn.intertradeireland.com), aren't you? **Aren't you?**
