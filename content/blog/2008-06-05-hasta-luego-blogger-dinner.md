As many people know, Tom Raftery is moving to Spain in the near future. Tom is, of course, a famous blogger and tech consultant but that sells him short. His energy, enthusiasm and openness should be a model for us all. I know I'm going to miss him locally, and not just from it@cork and OpenCoffee. At least we'll still have him [online](http://tomrafteryit.net/) :-)

To give him the send-off he deserves, I thought it might be nice to have a bloggers' dinner in Cork before he goes. Tuesday the 17th of June is the date we've picked. Venue is TBD but the aim is somewhere like Proby's.

Everyone is welcome, you really don't have to be a blogger (but you might be by the end of the night). However, as always, we need to know numbers so we can book appropriately. Please either leave a comment here or mail me at conor AT loudervoice DOT com before Thursday 12th if you want to attend. Equally importantly, do the same before the 17th if you change your mind!

Hope to see you there. I'll confirm venue early next week here.
