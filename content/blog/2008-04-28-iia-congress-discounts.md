[West Cork Enterprise Board](http://www.wceb.ie/) contacted me last week to let me know about a discount offer they had received from the [IIA](http://www.iia.ie/) for their client companies (and those of all CEBs). There was a further discount offered for being outside of Dublin too. Whilst the original price of €345 for non-members was just a bit at the high end for us, the double-discounted price of less than €150 is a bargain and I've signed up to attend.

If you are a WCEB client, just contact them and they'll send you on the code. If you are anywhere else, contact both your local CEB and irene AT iia  DOT ie to get the relevant code for your area. Strictly speaking the discounts ended on Friday but I'm sure they'll be flexible if lots of extra interest is shown.
