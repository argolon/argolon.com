Starting with [Saul in London](http://localglobe.blogspot.com/2007/02/opencoffee-club.html) followed quickly by [Eoghan in Dublin](http://www.eoghanmccabe.com/naive-by-design/first-dublin-opencoffee-club-a-great-success/) and [James/Jan in Limerick](http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/eirepreneur/2007/02/limerick_openco.html), it looks like the OpenCoffee Club idea really does have legs. The core idea is that a regular informal meeting is held in a coffee shop where we try to bring together entrepreneurs and investors to discuss topics of mutual interest, learn from each other and hopefully build lasting business relationships over time.

I'd like to propose an inaugural one in Cork City for next week. The idea of the first one will be to guage interest in doing it regularly, come up with some actions for getting more people in from both sides and also (as a side topic) to discuss the practicalities of Coworking in Cork.

Please leave your name in the comments if you are interested in meeting up next week (or pop me an email to conor at argolon dot com). Also suggest a decent sized place to hold it. If there is sufficient interest, I'll set it up and then contact Enterprise Ireland, CorkBIC/Business Angels Partnership and it@cork to spread the word. Anyone have County Enterprise Board contacts?
