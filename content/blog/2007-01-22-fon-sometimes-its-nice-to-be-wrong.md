I have written both [positively](https://www.argolon.com/2006/11/08/fon-up-and-running-in-bandon/) and [quite negatively](https://www.argolon.com/2007/01/08/these-so-called-free-fon-offers/) about [FON](http://www.fon.com/) on this blog. I had no success recently with redeeming a voucher for a free router and started to wonder if it fact the reality matched the PR. 

I did finally manage to order the free router by signing up with a dummy account using the same postal address as my real account. It just arrived, five weeks later. So I take it all back, those FON guys are straight up and I remain a big fan of the idea. Hopefully someone in Kensington in London has one so I get free wifi in my hotel when I'm at [FoWA](http://www.futureofwebapps.com/).
