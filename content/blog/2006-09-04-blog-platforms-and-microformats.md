Chris has done us all a service by writing [an open letter to Google](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2006/09/02/on-open-letter-to-blogger/) to get them to include more support for microformats in the Blogger revamp. It gets a hear-hear from me and from [John Allsopp](http://microformatique.com/?p=19).

On a related note, I've been playing with posting hCards to a bunch of different platforms and social networks. I'm doing it both with standard blog tools and just cut n paste. I've been surprised by which ones work and which ones don't. 

Obviously all the usual blog suspects work. Others that do include MySpace (!), PeopleAggregator and LiveJournal. Ones that don't include Vox (no raw HTML mode and I haven't got APP working yet), Bebo (no raw HTML mode) and Windows Live Spaces. I'm disappointed by the last one considering the effort Ray Ozzie has put into Live Clipboard. Surely that is a perfect place to allow people to play and would show material support for the community?

I'll post up a big table of the results when I finally finish my testing.
