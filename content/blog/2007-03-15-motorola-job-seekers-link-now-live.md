Deirdre Lacey from [it@cork](http://www.itcork.ie) contacted me to tell me about a page they have put on their site:



<blockquote>In response to Motorola's recent announcement, it@cork have set up a [Job Seekers Webpage](http://www.itcork.ie/index.cfm?page=cvlistings) on the it@cork website.

The page allows staff from Motorola to post their details if they are job seeking. Prospective employers can follow up directly with candidates via email links. This system has worked very well is similar circumstances throughout the country.

it@Cork wish all Motorola employees well in their future plans.
</blockquote>



This is a wonderful idea and I hope it works well for all involved. Deirdre also asked for any other Irish bloggers who see this to reblog it to build interest and potentially help the 300 people hitting the local jobs market at the same time.
