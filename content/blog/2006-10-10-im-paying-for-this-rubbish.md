I wouldn't mind if it was free, but these cowboys actually demand payment for this joke they call a service.

[Confirmed on boards.ie](http://boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2055000924) that there is a widespread broadband performance problem in Cork which appears to be due to an Eircom infrastructure problem as it is affecting both Eircom and BT customers. First reports occurred on Friday, we started suffering yesterday morning and the problem still persists. Do any of these companies actually employ anyone other than sales staff?

Two tin cans and some string might at least have an SLA. 

Repeat after me Eircom and BT management "Customer Customer Customer" "Service Service Service" "Priority Priority Priority".
