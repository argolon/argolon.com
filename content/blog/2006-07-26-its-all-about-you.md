If you need one reason, just one, why microformats are important, then you need to read Chris' [latest post about the hResume Wordpress plugin](http://factoryjoe.com/blog/2006/07/25/hresume-plugin-now-available/) over at FactoryCity. His comments are not just specific to [hResume](http://microformats.org/wiki/hresume), they are relevant for all microformat marked-up PCEK. PCEK (aka Peck) being a horrendous acronym I came up with about 10 minutes ago after reading [Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/07/25/Content) and it means "People Contributed Experience and Knowledge". The critical part of Chris' post is 

<blockquote>You maintain your resume on your site and you update it once and then ping others to let them know that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve updated your resume. And, when people discover your resume, they come to you in a context that represents you and lets you stand out rather than blending into a sea of homogeneous-looking documents.</blockquote>

. 

I've been asked several times what the key differentiator is in our business plan and that says it in a nutshell. It is about embracing and not fearing the idea of your information on your site under your control.
