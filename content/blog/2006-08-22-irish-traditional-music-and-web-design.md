I first heard of [Jason Santa Maria](http://www.jasonsantamaria.com) from Ryan Carson at the "How to build a WebApp" Workshop. Ryan raved about the design work that Jason is doing for the [Bare Naked App](http://www.barenakedapp.com/) ([Amigo](http://www.heyamigo.net/)). He showed us some of the steps they went through to get the logo and look of the site agreed and it was a big help to know what to expect when working with good designers. I've been subscribed to Jason's blog for a while and I like what I read. 

Last week he mentioned that he was doing a flying visit to Dublin. Yesterday [he revealed that he has been hired](http://www.jasonsantamaria.com/archive/2006/08/21/european_adventure.php) by [Comhaltas CeoltÃƒÂ³irÃƒÂ­ Ãƒâ€°ireann](http://www.comhaltas.com/) to do their web site redesign. Good on Comhaltas, they clearly know good design when they see it. And going by the look of the current web-site, they do need a revamp!

We're not ready to talk design yet with anyone but Jason is definitely someone whose opinion we would value when we are ready.
