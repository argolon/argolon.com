We are currently involved in a customer project which will probably need an injection of qualified contract developers in the the two months. Ideal candidates will have a background in developing J2EE-style applications (or similar). Head on over to our [jobs page](https://www.argolon.com/jobs) for a more detailed description. We will post more information when it starts firming up. If you are interested and potentially available over the next few months, shoot your CV over to hr@argolon.com.
