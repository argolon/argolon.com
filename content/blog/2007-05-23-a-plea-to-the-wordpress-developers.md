Please please please stop changing what I write. 

You don't know best. **I do**! 

If I enter three dots, I want three dots, not a bloody ellipsis. 

I don't want smart quotes. 

Don't replace my apostrophes with backticks.

I don't want my perfectly valid nested XHTML trashed when you "fix" it.

If I enter a div in the Rich Text Editor, I want a div, not a damned p.  

I swear, this behaviour reminds me most of Microsoft Word. 

What next? I enter "Dear Sir" and you ask me if I want to type a letter?

_Post what I type, not what you think I want._

Turn off all those "features" now and offer them as options for the minority who do want to see their text magically changed.

Please.
