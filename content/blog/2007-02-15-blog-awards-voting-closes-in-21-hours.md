So get those votes in. Make sure to check out all the great nominees over at [Jason Roe's Blog](http://www.jason-roe.com/blog/blog-awards-voting-opens/ ) and then vote in as many categories as possible. Just don't vote more than once or you'll be barred just like that time you tried to get into a nightclub with jeans on.
