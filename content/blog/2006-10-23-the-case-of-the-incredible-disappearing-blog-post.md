It appears [Damien's recent post](http://www.mulley.net/2006/08/23/open-letter-to-thinkhouse-pr-as-promised/) regarding spam from Thinkhouse PR [has disappeared from Google](http://www.mulley.net/2006/10/23/how-odd-my-thinkhouse-pr-blog-post-is-banned-from-google/#comments). 

Interesting that I can find spam without even trying on Google but I can't find a report of spam. 

Do no Evil eh?

Update 1: [From Damo](http://www.mulley.net/2006/10/23/dpc-ruling-on-mulley-v-thinkhouse-pr/) with a "ah shur they didn't realise it was spam the poor wee clueless darlings, would ye ever leave them alone" response from the DPC. Another Comreg on our hands?

Update 2: [From James](http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/eirepreneur/2006/10/google_didnt_ce.html), Google responds and states that it is an "algorithmic issue". We have to give them the benefit of the doubt here unless the algorithm is "SELECT BLOG_TEXT FROM MULLEY WHERE BLOG_TEXT NOT LIKE '%Thinkhouse%' ;-)
