I'm thrilled to see that the [YouGetItBack](http://www.yougetitback.com/) guys have launched the Beta versions of Laptop Superhero andÂ  Mobile Superhero (love the branding!). These are applications you install and are activated when your device is lost or stolen. For the well-intentioned finder, the app tells them how to contact YGIB so that they can return the device to you. For the badly-intentioned finder, it locks the devices down so they cannot be used.

I'll be installing both since my phone cost almost as much as my laptop! The range of phones they support is extensive and they support XP on laptops.

The only pity is that Bank Of Ireland didn't have something like this recently! Let them know what you think [over on the blog](http://www.yougetitback.com/blog/index.php/2008/04/21/beta-software-3).
