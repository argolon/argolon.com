Joe Drumgoole's venture [PutPlace](http://putplace.com/) now has the web-site up and running and they are accepting requests for sign-up. I've just entered my details and I'm looking forward to trying it out. 

What does it do? [Joe says](http://joedrumgoole.com/blog/2006/11/08/putplacecom-is-online/): 

<blockquote>It helps you to find, organise, secure and share  that huge and growing pile of photos, video, music, emails, documents and blog content that is building up day by day on you PC, phone, laptop and Media Centre.</blockquote>



I love the sound of this and it is definitely in the Digital Lifestyle Aggregator (DLA) zone that Marc Canter talks about.
