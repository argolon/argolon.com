I've just finished my first ever podcast. Krishna De got all of the nominees for the best Business Blog together for a chat about blogging. If you don't business blog and you are considering it, I think the conversations we had will be a good motivator. Those on the call were from a variety of backgrounds and levels of blogging experience (from 6 years to 4 months) and consisted of:

[Krishna De](http://www.krishnade.com/blog/)
[Kieran Murphy](http://icecreamireland.com/)
[Ann Green](http://www.allagi.ie/blog)
[Brian Honan](http://bhconsulting.blogs365.org/wordpress/)
[Damian O'Broin](http://www.askdirect.ie/)

Keep an eye on Krishna's site for the mp3.
