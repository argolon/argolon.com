If you need any more convincing that Yahoo are back in the game then [this announcement should do it](http://ylocalblog.com/blog/2006/06/21/we-now-support-microformats/). 

The Yahoo Local Blog wrote:

The trickle of data isn't such a trickle any more. If we look back next year, will that announcement be seen as the tipping point?

Tantek The Microformat Maestro also has [an important post over at his blog](http://tantek.com/log/2006/06.html#d17t2231). On the surface it is disarmingly simple discussion of open data formats, longevity, and microformats. But it has been on my mind since I read it. We all need to think hard and long about our personal data, where it is stored, how it is stored and how we and others will access and make use of it in the years to come. Now if only I could figure out how to post a comment on his blog (and also tell him that [Juice](http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/) can't see [the MP3 in his feed](http://tantek.com/log/2006/06.html#d19t1547)). Or maybe I just have.
