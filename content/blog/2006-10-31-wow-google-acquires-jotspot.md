Just saw [a posting on the Google Blog](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/spot-on.html) from Joe Kraus saying that Google have acquired [JotSpot](http://www.jot.com/). Big congrats to Joe and the team, it is much deserved. 

I'm totally convinced of the general utility of Wikis for a broad non-tech userbase and JotSpot was the poster child for that. If Google do manage to integrate it neatly into their other services then I think I'll have to dust off that old phrase "killer-app".
