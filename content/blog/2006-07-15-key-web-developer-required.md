 Argolon has started development on a new user-centric web application which will launch in Q1 2007. We are looking for a skilled and ambitious web-developer to lead the creation of our site. The ideal candidate will come from an application development background but with a strong understanding of Web UI design and a commitment to XHTML and CSS. The site will be developed with Agile languages, an Agile methodology and best-of-breed Web Frameworks. **If you want to drive the direction of a compelling Web 2.0 application** and have many of the following, then we want to hear from you:



  * End-to-end WebApp development

  * Large scale application development using Python, Ruby, PHP or Perl

  * Distributed and high-performance application architectures using PostgreSQL, MySQL or Oracle

  * Data modelling and ORM

  * ATOM/RSS

  * XHTML/CSS/Semantic Markup

  * AJAX UIs

  * Web Frameworks such as Django, Turbogears, Pylons, Rails, Zend, Symfony or CodeIgniter







This is a permanent position based in Cork, Ireland and the salary/benefits package will be commensurate with experience.
