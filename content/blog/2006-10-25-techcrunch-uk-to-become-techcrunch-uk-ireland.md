I know it's a small thing but I'm really happy [Sam is doing the rename](http://uk.techcrunch.com/2006/10/24/techcrunch-uk-event-calendar/#comment-9677). Did Fergus and Tom accost him at the launch party last week?

Let's give him plenty of news from this side of the Irish sea!

Hopefully our new venture will have something he can write about in the coming months. I just need to change the branding on the new blog this week and I'll start talking more about it.
