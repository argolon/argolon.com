Why are Microsoft and [Eventful](http://www.eventful.com) not shouting this from the rooftops? 

You can now find an event in Eventful (e.g. [this Divine Comedy one](http://eventful.com/events/E0-001-001122611-7) in Cork), right-click the Live Clipboard Icon, click copy, go to Windows Live Writer and do paste. Not only do you now have all that event information in your blog post, it is fully marked-up as a [hCalendar](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar) item and you can link to the original source.

Well done to all involved in this. Once it is two-way (copying my event blog entries to Eventful in two clicks), I'll never use another blog tool again. Now all we need is is for Outlook 2007 and LinkedIn to support this functionality with [hCard](http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard).



UPDATE: Eventful now have two blog posts on it. The first one is [the formal press release](http://blog.eventful.com/archives/2006/09/eventful_and_mi.html) and the second is [a step-by-step guide](http://blog.eventful.com/archives/2006/10/more_on_the_eve.html) to using the plug-in.
