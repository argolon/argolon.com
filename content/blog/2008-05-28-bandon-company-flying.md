I love seeing local biz doing well at an international level and [Newsweaver](http://www.newsweaver.ie/) seems to be on fire at the minute. From an unassuming office on Weir Street and another down Factory Lane in Bandon, they have recently been named the fifth fastest growing technology company in Ireland in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50.

They added to their list of achievements the other night by winning the eMarketing category at the All-Ireland Marketing Awards organised by The Marketing Institute of Ireland. They did this beating off competition from Aer Lingus, Anglo Irish Bank, Cybercom, and Tourism Ireland.

I'd love to see Bandon become the tech hub of Cork. Easy access to everywhere, none of the traffic problems of the city and a quickly growing population. At the rate they are growing, Newsweaver could  become the centre of a tech cluster and "the Valley" could eventually mean the Bandon Valley!
