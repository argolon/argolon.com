Jan over at [Touristr](http://www.touristr.com/) has written [a really useful post](http://blog.touristr.com/articles/2007/02/01/irish-tips-to-launch-your-web-app-with-little-cash) on spending as little as possible on building a web-app here. 

We've avoided going down the bank loan route as we assumed that a pre-launch start-up would have a hard time securing one. The Seed Capital Scheme is definitely worth a look and the Feasibility Study Grant really is fantastic.
