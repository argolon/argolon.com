The disaster that was the information site about Cork OpenCoffee has finally been resolved. No more re-directs to Upcoming or Eventful. We now have [a nice clean blog](http://corkopencoffee.org/) which you can subscribe to via RSS or email. We'll keep it fully up to date with everything that is happening in OCC here. 

If you have anything you want to share with the group, use any of the contacts methods listed on the site to send it through. I'm also eager for it to be a group blog and I'll happily hand out logins to anyone who wants to contribute.

Oh, and Friday's OCC in the Rubicon Centre was fantastic. There will be a full post over at [corkopencoffee.org](http://corkopencoffee.org/) later but just a big thank you to Paul Healy for making it happen, Mr Cotton Coffee for sponsoring the great coffee and [Lukulu](http://www.lukulu.com/) for taking care of the scones.
