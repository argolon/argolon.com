[The Register has a pointed article](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/24/bmc-sorm/) on the BMC SORM (Service Oriented Resource Management) announcements. Further into the article they quote Gartner as saying, in its "Hype Cycle for IT Operations Management, 2005" that CMDBs are  at the "peak of inflated expectations" with the "plateau of productivity" some 10 years out.

Whilst it does appear that CMDBs are all the rage right now and that inflated expectations will (as ever) lead to half-baked solutions and disappointed customers, we have seen plenty of benefit being gained right now in the implementation of limited scope CMDBs targetted at particular technology-business relationships in IT Service Management and Delivery.
