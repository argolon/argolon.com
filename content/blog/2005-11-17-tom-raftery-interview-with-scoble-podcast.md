For the non-Irish readers of this site, Tom Raftery has one of [the most popular and best Irish technology blogs](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/). He has just done a great interview with Robert Scoble which is [now available as a podcast](http://www.tomrafteryit.net/robert-scoble-podcast/). Scoble is coming over to talk at the [IT@Cork Annual Conference](http://www.itcork.ie/index.cfm?page=events&eventId=53). This should be a fantastic day but it looks like we won't be able to make it due to business travel. 

Whether you are going to the annual conference or not, grab the MP3 and have a good listen. The enthusiasm is infectious!
