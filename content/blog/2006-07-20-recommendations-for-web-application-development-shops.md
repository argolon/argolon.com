We intend to outsource the bulk of the development of our application. This will be broken down into several areas including:




  1. Design
  2. XHTML/CSS
  3. Application development
  4. Hosting
  5. Operations


I have received plenty of recommendations for Design and some for XHTML/CSS but other than Ryan Carson recommending Nick in Plum Digital Media (and more on yesterday's "How to build a WebApp" workshop later), it is proving difficult to get recommendations for top-class web application development houses. I am following up on some leads but thought it would be useful to cast the net wider.

We are completely open on the location but obviously we will be keeping a close eye on the cost. One-man shops are not sufficient for our needs, this is a meaty application requiring several developers and (as per the recent job posting) strong skills in architecture and scalability. 

If you have any personal recommendations for dev shops in Ireland, UK, Europe, Eastern Europe, Russia or India, we would deeply appreciate any contact names you can give us. If you don't want to post a public comment, feel free to mail me at conor [at] argolon dot com. Alternatively, if you know of good sites/forums where this type of information is exchanged, we'd appreciate that too. Of course, feel free to make recommendations on any of the other areas and names of ones to avoid are equally valuable.
