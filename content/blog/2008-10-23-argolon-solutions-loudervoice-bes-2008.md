We have just kicked off our BES 2008 offering which is built around the [LouderVoice](http://business.loudervoice.com/) business. If you are interested in hearing more about this investment opportunity or discussing direct equity investments, please contact Conor O'Neill on conor AT loudervoice DOT com or +353-87-9790297.

Over the past few months we have been trialling our business services with several clients. Some of those are already live, others will go live over the next quarter. We now have [a very nice brochure site](http://business.loudervoice.com/) to go with these services and a very powerful content moderation back-end for our clients.

The [LouderVoice for Business site](http://business.loudervoice.com/) gives the high level overview of our services which are currently in three areas:



* White-label review service based on a secure XML API
* SMS reviews and customer feedback
* Custom review widgets



Put simply, reviews help sales. In these difficult economic times, our services provide a critical competitive advantage to our customers.
