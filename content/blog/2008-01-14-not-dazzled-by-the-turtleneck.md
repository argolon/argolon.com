Ewan Spence [slices through the usual fan-boy nonsense](http://www.ewanspence.com/blog/2008/01/14/predicting-my-macworld-coverage-and-the-steve-jobs-keynote/) and looks forward to the Jobs keynote at MacWorld. Let him know what you think.

Whilst it's nice to be able to flick photos with your index finger, I prefer a phone that has phone features like 3G, HSDPA, Bluetooth etc.

And why does no-one ever comment on the Apple TV flop?

Review of the best business phone ever made, the Nokia N95 8GB, coming soon.
