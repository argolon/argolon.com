Cross-posting from the LouderVoice Blog:

We are incredibly excited that an opportunity to attend [TechCrunch40](http://www.techcrunch20.com/) in San Francisco next week has appeared. It is all due to the wonderful Pat Phelan of [Cubic Telecom ](http://blog.roam4free.ie/techcrunch20-competition/)who offered a free ticket to a well deserving start-up. LouderVoice is that start-up and I'll be there from Sunday until Wednesday afternoon.

If you are in the Bay area and would like to meet up and talk business and technology or you are from the investment community, I'd love to see you whilst I am there. We have some very exciting features coming soon in LouderVoice which will help make it **the** place to find great reviewers around the globe. Conor will be on +353-87-9790297
