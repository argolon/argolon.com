I attended [Le Web](http://www.lewebparis.com/) on Tue/Wed this week in Paris. It is the leading web conference in Europe and this was my third year.

Despite a bunch of logistical problems, Loic and Geraldine Le Meur created yet another event that will stick in the mind for a long time. 

I was at the conference with multiple hats on:

 



* CEO of [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/) eager to meet potential partners and investors
* Guest Author for [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/) looking at Le Web from technology perspective
* Co-Editor of [Web2Ireland](http://web2ireland.org/) looking at Le Web from business perspective

 

My [Web2Ireland post](http://web2ireland.org/2008/12/11/lovin-le-web/) covers the general business mood and how it may affect Irish start-ups.

My [ReadWriteWeb post](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/le_web_2008.php) covers some of the interesting directions that the technology is taking.

Looking forward to 2009.
