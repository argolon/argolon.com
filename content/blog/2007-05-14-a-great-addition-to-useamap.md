Vinny Glennon has a genuinely useful site in [UseAMap](http://useamap.com). Starting from the simple idea of doing a "TinyURL for Maps", Vinny has built one of my favourite mapping apps. 

The most recent addition is a huge boon to those of us who live in The Google Maps Darklands - UseAMap is now integrated with Yahoo Maps too. 

Both Yahoo and Microsoft do a far superior job of mapping West Cork than Google. This is very surprising giving how many billion dollars Google funnels through Ireland every year. I doubt they'd miss a few euro going to the Ordnance Survey.

Here is [an example of a location](http://useamap.com/opencoffeecork) I have set in UseAMap.

Check it out.
