Given the lack of free wireless at FoWA and the disastrous wireless at LeWeb3, it struck me yesterday that conferences are the ideal opportunity for FON to give people real hands-on experience of their routers. 

Imagine if the guys had provided all the wifi for free yesterday? They could still use the logon screens so they get the branding opportunities but it would have been such a coup! Maybe an idea for some of the upcoming European conferences?

Or maybe offer it non-free to most people and free as usual to FONeros with the strong message that if you become a FONero, you'll get it free at the next conference

Hey [Antoin](http://www.eire.com/) - how about a trial run at the Irish Blog Awards on March 3rd?
