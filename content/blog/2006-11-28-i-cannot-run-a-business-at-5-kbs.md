Recommendations please for reliable broadband in the Bandon, Cork area that makes no use of the Eircom network. 

We were dead in the water for a week the last time. We've been crawling for 24 hours this time. BT needs to do something now about LLU or the Wimax boys will eat their dinner when it is rolled out.
