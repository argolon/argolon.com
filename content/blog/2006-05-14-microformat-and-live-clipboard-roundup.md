The buzz surrounding microformats and how they can be used to create new and better services is getting louder and louder. In the past month there have been some eye-opening blog postings and articles on them. 

Here are just a few to whet the appetite:

[Phil Haack has the best introduction to microformats I have read](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/05/11/IntroductionToMicroformatsArticle.aspx).

[Alex Barnett coins a new acronym with mRc  = microformats + RSS + clipboard](http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2006/05/12/595899.aspx). His article and [Jason Kolb's](http://jasonkolb.typepad.com/weblog/2006/05/cutting_out_the.html) really address some of the exciting possibilities presented by Ray Ozzie's Live Clipboard. With Microsoft driving this bandwagon, I'm convinced Alex and Jason are not just in the realm of flight's of fancy.

In fact, Jason has a stream of very relevant posts on microformats and Live Clipboard. [This one linking over to M David Peterson](http://jasonkolb.typepad.com/weblog/2006/05/a_glimpse_of_th.html) on Live Clipboard and Amazon S3 throws up a few more possibilities.  

[Sam Sethi's post on bi-directional microformats using SSE](http://samsethi.typepad.com/sethi/2006/05/bidirectional_m.html) describes some profound changes in the way microformatted data could be automatically updated.
 
[Danny Ayers gives a great example](http://dannyayers.com/2006/04/14/personal-persistent-live) of how Expedia and Yahoo could be integrated via a Live Clipboard approach. 

This thing is snowballing. The apps can't be far behind, can they?
