I've been struggling with Vista on a Dell D420 laptop recently. It is described as "Vista Capable". It is nothing of the sort. So tonight I reverted back to XP Pro and have started the long slow re-install of all my favourite applications. This is what I pretty much always install on XP machines now:



* Windows XP SP2 plus all updates
* Internet Explorer 7
* Firefox (plus some standard add-ons)
* KeePass password manager
* Nokia N-Series PC Suite
* PDFCreator
* AVG Anti-Virus
* Microsoft Office 2007
* Adobe Acrobat Reader
* Pidgin Instant Messenger
* Filezilla FTP Client
* Skype
* OpenOffice
* Sun Java JDK
* Putty SSH Client
* MySQL Tools
* Adobe Flash
* Adobe Shockwave (no idea why I need this!)
* Activestate Python 2.5 (plus a bunch of modules)
* Adobe AIR
* Twhirl Twitter Client
* Google Toolbar x2
* Google Gears
* Azureus Bittorrent Client
* JungleDisk Amazon S3 Backup
* Paint.NET
* Subversion version control
* bzr version control
* Flock Browser
* Quicktime (only when needed)
* RealPlayer (or Real Alternative)

Any other interesting ones you use?
