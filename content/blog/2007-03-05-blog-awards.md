We had a wonderful night at the Irish Blog Awards on Saturday. Big congrats to [Kieran Murphy](http://icecreamireland.com/2007/03/04/ice-cream-ireland-scoops-two-awards/) who won Best Business Blog (and Best Speciality Blog) and [Bernie Goldbach](http://irish.typepad.com/irisheyes/2007/03/irisheyes_at_ir.html) who won Best Technology Blogger (and Best Contribution to the Irish Bloggersphere which he in turn gave to Damien). They are two of my favourite bloggers globally and richly deserve the awards.

Krishna De has also [released the podcast ](http://www.krishnade.com/blog/2007/business-blogging-podcast/)of all the Business Blog nominees discussing blogging last week.
