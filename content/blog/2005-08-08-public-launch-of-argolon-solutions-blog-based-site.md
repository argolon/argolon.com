We are thrilled to finally do a public launch of our Wordpress-based website. We have decided to re-structure around blogs and discussions in general. This site is still in Alpha but we hope that making it public will accelerate it's completion and encourage community participation.

The Storage community is poorly served by sites dedicated to discussing the issues important to them. Both "[Byte & Switch](http://www.byteandswitch.com/)" and "[Search Storage](http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/)" are fine news sites and B&S; does have some very quiet forums. But those two plus eWeek are pretty much all there is for a very large sub-section of the IT industry.

Ireland has many of the players in the Storage Industry (EMC, Dell, StorageTek, Sun, HP etc) with operations here. I hope we can create a vibrant forum for industry and technical interchange. 

Please bear with us as we build this site further.
