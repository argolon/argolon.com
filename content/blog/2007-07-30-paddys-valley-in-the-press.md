The [Irish Times has covered](http://www.ireland.com/newspaper/finance/2007/0730/1185230138715.html) the latest press release about our [Paddy's Valley trip](http://paddysvalley.org/). The support of Enterprise Ireland in not just important but it is really getting noticed by the press. [Finfacts](http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_1010703.shtml) also give us a mention and I was interviewed by [Cork 103FM](http://www.103fm.ie/) and [ENN](http://www.enn.ie/). There are still plenty of places left but we will be setting a cut-off date soon so head on over to the site, read all about it, ask questions, make comments and then sign up if you like the idea.
