We run across many interesting articles on technology and business over the course of an average week. Many are worth reading but not necessarily blogging about. In order to give an insight into the areas that are taking up our thought time, we have created a [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) page for our bookmarks. For those of you unfamiliar with this service, an explanation would probably help. At it's most simple, del.icio.us is an online bookmark service. However, with the addition of a tagging system it becomes a lot more powerful than a simple hierarchical structure. In addition it provides an RSS feed so you can find out with zero effort when we have added links. Let us know what you think.
