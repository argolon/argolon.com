Gordon Murray from eWrite is a [Cork OpenCoffee](http://corkopencoffee.org/) stalwart and his eWrite business has been very successful in Ireland. They provide web CMSes and Apps for SMEs. They have put a lot of work into protecting the forms on their customers sites against spam and recently decided to spin this out as a product in itself.

This is one of those simple but extremely useful apps. You can select from a set of forms on the [eWrite Forms site](http://www.ewriteforms.com/) and then embed that on your own site. They will also build you whatever form you need for a small fee and they take care of protecting it against spam entries.

eWrite is currently offering a one month free trial and if you are nice to Gordon at the next OpenCoffee, he might have some other offers there too!
