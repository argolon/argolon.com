[They've just done an overview](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/02/04/online-photo-editing-overview/) of all the online Photo Editors out there and once again [PXN8](http://www.pxn8.com) gets a very favourable mention. Walter is a shining example of what a tiny team with a great developer and a very strong commercial instinct can achieve. Everything to date has been entirely self-funded and the application just gets better and better. If anyone is looking to do a case study on on how to do things right in Web2, I can't think of a better example than [Sxoop](http://www.sxoop.com) Technologies, a small, focused, revenue generating, Cork-based Irish web company.
