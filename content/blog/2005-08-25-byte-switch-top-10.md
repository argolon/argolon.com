B&S; have updated their list of what they consider to be the [Top 10 Privately owned Storage companies](http://www.byteandswitch.com/document.asp?doc_id=78976&WT.svl=news1_2). The one that is most interesting for us is obviously [Glasshouse](http://www.glasshouse.com/). They are the 50-ton gorilla in the independent storage consultancy field. Whilst we are not quite in their league (yet!), we do talk to the same customer base. 

Their ability to grow the business over the past few years and win deals when going up against the PS wings of the global storage players is very impressive. They have been able to successfully grow both organically and by acquisition by having a single-minded focus on  their niche. Whilst they clearly have strong IP to enable the service they offer, it is probably to their advantage, at least for the moment, not to have a product offering which might make the services sell more difficult. A company to watch and learn from,  for sure.
