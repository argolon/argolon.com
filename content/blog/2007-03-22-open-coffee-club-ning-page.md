Saul and the guys have setup a [Ning page for Open Coffee](http://opencoffee.ning.com/). Ning is basically a social networking app. On the page you can see members, recent blog posts tagged with opencoffee, ditto pictures and more importantly Upcoming.org events that are tagged. It is one central place to find out what is happening in OpenCoffee globally.

On a more local level, as part of that, I have created an Upcoming.org group called (funnily enough) [The Cork Open Coffee Club](http://upcoming.org/group/2849/). This is where we post details of the time and location of upcoming Club meetings. You can indicate your attendance/interest and post topics, comments and questions. Please use this plus the Ning page from now on to keep up to date. 

RSS Feed for our Upcoming.org events [is here](http://upcoming.org/syndicate/v2/group/2849/d37e8909da/). Upcoming also does exports of the events to Outlook etc. Remember no matter what site you are mentioning OpenCoffee on, if they have a tagging facility, use the opencoffee tag.

I'll still post semi-regular info here in case people miss this announcement. I'll also put a link to both sites in the sidebar.

Anyone in the UK doing a logo?
