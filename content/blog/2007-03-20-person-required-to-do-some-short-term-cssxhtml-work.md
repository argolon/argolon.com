As [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/) races towards full launch, we have a requirement for someone to do CSS and XHTML work for us between now and then. Basically this person will have to take our existing design, apply it to any new features and pages on the site and tweak what is there already. 

This isn't a huge amount of work (time-scale is over the next few weeks and effort is probably less than a person-week), does not require design expertise and would suit anyone between major contracts or looking for a nice side project to exercise their mark-up muscles. There will probably be future opportunities for follow-on work.

We use a templating system called Kid but it is very straightforward and requires minimal learning effort. You can be located anywhere worldwide since we are based in Cork Ireland and you'll be working with developers in the UK and Sweden.

If this sounds interesting please contact me on conor at argolon DOT com. Alternatively, if you know of anyone that this might suit, then please forward it on to them. Ideally we are looking for someone who can start yesterday!
