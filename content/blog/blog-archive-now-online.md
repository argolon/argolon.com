After an absence of over seven years, the old Argolon Blog, which was active from 2005 until 2010, is back online. This is really just for posterity and to ensure the history of this Irish startup remains accessible for the foreseeable future. We hope you enjoy browsing and having a chuckle over posts like [our 2009 predictions](/2008/12/27/our-2009-predictions/).
