[James Corbett](http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/eirepreneur/2008/01/map-of-irish-wi.html) is building [a map of Wifi Hotspots](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&msid=112855554048460880778.0004358aea20ba94cba25&z=4&om=0) around the country. Whilst they can be free or non-free, I hope we can identify as many free ones as possible first. I've added the ones I know of in Cork and indicated whether they are publicly accessible locations or not.

If you know of any, please spread the love and add a push-pin to the map. You should also include any FON hotspots that you know of.

UPDATE 1: Don't forget Eircom's map of[ their hotspots](http://www.eircom.ie/hotspot). These currently cost me nothing as an Eircom broadband subscriber. Hopefully they will extend the scheme indefinitely.

UPDATE 2: Also don't forget the map of [FON Hotspots](http://maps.fon.com/). These are free for Linus FONeros and cheap for others. There aren't many in Ireland but hopefully we'll grow it more.
