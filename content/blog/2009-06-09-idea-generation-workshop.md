Very good idea from West Cork Enterprise Board:

They are running 3 one-day Idea Generation Workshops over the coming weeks. The workshops are for people who are thinking about starting their own business but don’t have a business idea in mind yet and also people who have a business idea but want to study the idea further.

They will help people decide whether self-employment is the right route for them. Topics covered during the workshop will include: What does it mean to be an entrepreneur? How are new business ideas generated; How to select and develop a business idea and what steps should be taken when you have decided on your business idea. Delivered in a practical manner, case studies will be used and future worldwide trends will be discussed.
