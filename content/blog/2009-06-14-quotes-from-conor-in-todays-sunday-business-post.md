[The SBP](http://www.thepost.ie/) has an excellent supplement about Cork in today's edition. Hopefully it'll make it onto their web-site at some stage. Caroline Allen dedicated the entire back page to start-ups and include quotes from CorkBIC, Rubicon Centre, it@cork and Argolon/[LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/). The full piece is well worth a read, particularly considering the same message was coming loud and clear from us all. Hopefully someone in Government will read it and get that message!

Here's a rough scan of my thoughts as a start-up founder, Genesis alumni, organiser of [Cork OpenCoffee](http://www.corkopencoffee.org/) and editor of [Web2Ireland.org](http://www.web2ireland.org/).

One quote which didn't make it into the SBP but which is critical to my thinking:





<blockquote>

> 
> A bottom-up approach has to be taken, contended O'Neill. We need to give the maximum number of people a chance to succeed, rather than cherry picking.
>

</blockquote>



UPDATE 1: After some old-school cutting and pasting, I have [scanned the entire article as a PDF](https://www.argolon.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/SBP_Cork_Startups_20090614.pdf). Enjoy.

UPDATE 2: Some coverage of the piece by [Bernie Goldbach](http://www.insideview.ie/).
