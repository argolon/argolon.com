Jan Blanchard has been building a great travel site called [Touristr](http://www.touristr.com/) for quite a while. I did some beta testing for him a while back and the potential was obvious. With their latest open beta, they've really improved the look and navigation of the site.

In their own words:



<blockquote>
TouristR allows you to save favorite flags onto your personal map, create itineraries for your next holiday and book great deals from local providers. 
Post your pics and stories, rate flags and add your own travel adventures. You can make or break someone's holiday! lead by example.
Experienced travellers have left golden nuggets of information. Sign up to read their tips and reviews and get on the unbeaten track
</blockquote>



I think they have a winner on their hands.
