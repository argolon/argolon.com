    Lead Web Developer Required
    

Listed: Jan 19 2007 10:30:00 UTC


	

Expires: Apr 30 2007 10:30:00 UTC







We are currently using a full outsource model for both the development and design of [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/). We are aiming to change this to a hybrid inhouse/outsource approach as we get closer to full launch.




To that end we are looking to hire a full-time experienced web developer. If you have a strong background in end-to-end web development and **you are looking for all the opportunities that being the lead developer in a start-up provides** then we want to hear from you. Ideally you will be based in Cork but in fact we're open to talking to developers around the country. Some of the things we are looking for include:






  * Experience as lead developer of MVC-style web applications
  * Strong background in agile languages, particularly Python
  * Deep knowledge of web frameworks such as TurboGears (which we use), Django, Pylons, Rails, Code Igniter or similar
  * Successful history of working with offshore and distributed development and design teams
  * Expertise in creating high-performance scalable application architectures using MySQL
  * ATOM/RSS
  * Commitment to XHTML/CSS/Semantic Markup
  * Ajax UIs






This is a permanent position based in Ireland and the salary/benefits package will be commensurate with experience.
