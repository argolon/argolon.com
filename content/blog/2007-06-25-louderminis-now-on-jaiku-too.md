We announced LouderTweets recently, which are 140 character mini-reviews you can send to [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/) from [Twitter](http://twitter.com/) without needing a LouderVoice account. 

Last night we turned on LouderViesti which is the equivalent feature for the superb [Jaiku](http://jaiku.com/). Jaiku is like Twitter but can do much much more. They are based in Finland and are adding great features at a fast rate. 

We are now calling LouderTweets+LouderViesti = LouderMinis!

Using LouderViesti is even easier than LouderTweets.




* Sign Up on [Jaiku](http://www.jaiku.com/) if you are not already a member
* Join the [#reviews channel](http://jaiku.com/channel/reviews)
* On the #reviews channels page, write reviews using the following format:
* RatingOutOf5 Item Name. Review Text
* For [example](http://jaiku.com/channel/reviews/presence/5136802):
* 3 Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc. Cheap for Marlborough. Not at Villa Maria or Montana level
* That's it! Within 30 minutes [that review](http://www.loudervoice.com/search?q=Oyster+Bay) will be searchable/rateable/bookmarkable/shareable on LouderVoice

	Of course if you have registered your mobile with Jaiku, you can send reviews from that too

* Just send a text message to +46 737 494 0501 in the following format:
* #reviews 3 Oyster Bay Sauvignon Blanc. Cheap for Marlborough. Not at Villa Maria or Montana level
* That's all there is to it! Give it a twirl. We have some fun ideas for it that we'll announce next week
