Drew McLellan has [done a short movie](http://theoneinthehat.com/microformats/hcalendar-endo.mov) showing how to go from subscribing to someone's RSS feed which contains hCalendar events using a microformat-aware reader to importing that into iCal with just a few clicks. And of course it doesn't just have to be into iCal. Simple, powerful.
