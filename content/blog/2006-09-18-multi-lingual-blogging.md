Haydn Shaughnessy started a blog back in May called [Mediangler](http://www.mediangler.com/) and in a very short period of time it has become a must-read for me. He is attending [BarCampIreland](http://argolon.com/barcampireland/) and we'll be badgering him to give a talk.

[He did a post](http://www.mediangler.com/2006/09/15/blogde-a-multilingual-blog/) about [blog.de](http://www.blog.de/) the other day and it immediately grabbed my attention. This is a German blog site which is fully i18n'ed and allows blogging in many languages. I recently did a study of a ton of blogs around the globe trying to see if you can reliably tell the language that a blog post is written in. You can't! Nearly every blog I checked said that it was en-US irrespective of the language used.

Fingers crossed that blog.de does it better than most. I'm signing up for an account now.
