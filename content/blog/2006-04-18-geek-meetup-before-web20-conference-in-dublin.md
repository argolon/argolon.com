Robert Smith has arranged a meet-up in the [Market Bar](http://www.pod.ie/about_mkt.php) off Sth Great Georges Street for next Wednesday April 26th. This is a Gastropub-style place which specialises in Tapas. To avoid meet-up analysis-paralysis Robert has smartly just specified the location and post-6pm as the time. I'll be driving up from Cork so I'll be there a little later.

I'm looking forward to meeting a good gaggle of Irish Bloggers, those working in the tech industry here, [Marc Canter](http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/04/windows-home-media-center-competition-now-owned-by-yahoo) and hopefully some of the other speakers.

In case you don't know Dublin, [Fade Street is here](http://local.live.com/?v=2&sp=aN.53.342025_-6.264257_Fade%20Street_The%20Market%20Bar).
