I've been a big fan of [Jason Calacanis](http://www.calacanis.com/) for a long time. Many of the Weblogs Inc properties are my favourite sites on the web and I've always found his clear-headed directness to be the perfect antidote to a lot of the west coast kumbya that I read. 

He recently started podcasting and if you are involved in a web business, you'd be a fool to miss them. Each edition is jam packed full of smart insights and tips for web entrepreneurs. So when I just read [on TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/05/calacanis-takes-position-at-sequoia-capital/) that he has joined Sequoia Capital as an EIA (Entrepreneur in Action), I wasn't surprised at all. This is a very smart move by Sequoia and let's hope it doesn't blunt either his blogging or podcasting. I doubt it will.
