[Keith has uploaded videos](http://bohanna.typepad.com/pureplay/2007/02/video_upload_fi.html) of the "Finding money for your start-up" session. I enjoyed the differing views of the panel on this topic but anyone who thought they'd come away with "so that's how I do it" would have been disappointed. There should definitely be a follow-up session at BarCamp Dublin with a focus on successful early-stage tech startup fund-raising.
