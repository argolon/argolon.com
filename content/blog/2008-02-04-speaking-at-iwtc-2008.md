I'm very pleased to have been [invited to speak](http://iwtc.firstport.ie/bio.aspx?sid=58) at the Irish Web Technology Conference on 28th February in Dublin. My 75 minute session is about SMS, Location Based Services and Social Networking. I'll be very much doing this as an eager punter and coming from the web side rather than from the mobile industry. I hope that provides some new perspectives in this area. The summary is as follows:


<blockquote>After many years of being "almost there", it looks like 2008 may finally be the year of mobile internet. More importantly, the lines between mobile and the mainstream web are becoming blurred. Most of the really exciting applications recently have been hybrid web/mobile ones.

In this session Conor O'Neill will present an overview of some of the most interesting hybrid applications in the consumer space. Starting with the opportunities presented by simple SMS integration to web-sites, he will also look at some of the cutting edge applications in the area of Location Based Services and Social Networking. He intends this to be a highly interactive session and positively encourages audience contribution and feedback.</blockquote>


Hopefully I'll meet some of you there
