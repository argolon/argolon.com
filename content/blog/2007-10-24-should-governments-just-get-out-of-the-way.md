Whilst I've had a lot of conversations with other start-ups about how the Government can help entrepreneurs more, I've also had a few with those who think it should do less.

One of those, an ex-pat Irish Angel, whose thoughts we hope to be able to share with a wider audience in the coming weeks, sent me this link to an article in The Economist.

[The Fading Lustre of Clusters](http://www.economist.com/specialreports/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9928211).

Well worth a read.
