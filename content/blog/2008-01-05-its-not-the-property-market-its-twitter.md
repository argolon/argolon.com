Brian Cowen got it all wrong in the December budget. Exchequer receipts were not down in 2007 due to the property market collapse, it's because we were all on Twitter.

Pat Phelan and Florian Seroussi have [calculated a $13.5B hit to the global economy](http://blog.roam4free.ie/never-mind-what-are-twitter-costs-whats-the-cost-of-twitter/) due to Twitter usage reducing productivity in 2007. Using the Runge Kutta Algorithm adjusted by the gAb factor, that's a â‚¬4B hit on the Irish economy!
