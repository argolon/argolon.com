A few years back we were pitching to a large customer for a piece of work. This customer had a lot of problems and we spent two days listening to them pour their hearts out to us. Towards the end we identified a few specific things we would be able to improve for them in a major way and limited our commitments to that. As we were leaving, they thanked us for being the first vendor in a long time who really listened properly to them and didn't just try to sell them a bunch of inappropriate software. Unsurprisingly, we still do a lot of business with them.

That meeting was brought to mind by Guy Kawasaki's recent posting on [The Art of Schmoozing](http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/the_art_of_schm.html).  His third point in particular addresses how we have always sold our services: "Ask good questions and then shut up". Keep it in mind the next time you want to get to the heart of a customer's needs.
