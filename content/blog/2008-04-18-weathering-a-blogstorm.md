One aspect of blogging (particularly business blogging) that worries some people is when something negative is written about them. This can sometimes erupt into a blogstorm with a huge hullabaloo across multiple blogs. I've seen a few over the past few years and each company/person handled it differently.

Frank Prendergast has written [a very thoughtful post](http://websitedesigncork.com/blog/blogging/negative-feedback-weathering-a-blogstorm) on this topic and I'll be recommending it to all new (and old!) bloggers. The essence of his advice is to keep a level head, state your case, apologise if you are in the wrong and move on. It's an approach I've always tried to use despite emotion getting the better of me sometimes.
