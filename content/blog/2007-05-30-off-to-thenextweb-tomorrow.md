I'm hitting Amsterdam at 5pm tomorrow for both the International OCC and TheNextWeb Conference. I'll demo LouderVoice to as many people as I can and I'm looking forward to the VC Speed Pitching session at lunchtime Friday. I'd better practice my elevator pitch tonight.

If you want to contact me from midday Thursday onwards I'll be on +372-53-166646 (roam4free) or +353-87-9790297 (main mobile). I'll be grabbing email on Thursday evening and probably not again until Friday night.
