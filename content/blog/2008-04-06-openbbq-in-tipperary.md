Cross-posting from the [Cork OpenCoffee Blog](http://corkopencoffee.org/):
What started [as a discussion](http://jaiku.com/channel/irishopencoffee/presence/30711232) about having an OpenCoffee in the Midlands the other day quickly turned into a proposal for an OpenBBQ in Terryglass on Lough Derg this summer.

Think business networking, free Wifi, top class BBQ and fun.

[Evert has all the detail](http://wimaxxed.blogspot.com/2008/04/open-coffee-club-bbq.html)s so far. Please drop him a line if you think you might go. Heâ€™s thinking June/July mid-week. If there is enough interest from Cork OpenCoffee we could consider hiring a mini-bus?






UPDATE 1: Please [vote for your preferred date](http://wimaxxed.blogspot.com/2008/04/occ-bbq-part-two.html) over on the blog too.
