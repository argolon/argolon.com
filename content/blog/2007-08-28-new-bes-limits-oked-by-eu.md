I've just heard (via [Joe Drumgoole](http://joedrumgoole.com/blog/2007/08/28/bes-has-been-approved/)'s blog) that the new BES limits annnounced last November have finally been approved by the EU. This is fantastic news.

This is the [official EU newsletter announcement](http://ec.europa.eu/comm/competition/state_aid/register/ii/by_case_nr_n2007_0270.html#287):



<blockquote>
N 287 / 2007 - Business Expansion Scheme (BES), incorporating the Seed Capital Scheme (SCS).

Primary Objective:	Risk capital
Aid instrument:	Provision of risk capital
Tax allowance
Case Type:	Scheme
Duration:	from 01.07.2007 to 31.12.2013
 
 
Notification or Registration Date:	23.05.2007
DG Responsible:	Competition DG
Related Procedures:	N 311 / 2004

This presumably means that Enterprise Ireland should be processing new company certs starting five days ago and the Revenue Commissioners should be approving RICTs.

UPDATE 1: [Looks like](http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/article_1010963.shtml) new legislation required to deal with some provisos set by EU. This is coming "shortly". Presumably when the Dáil reconvenes. Shouldn't cause any hold-up with new company certs tho.
