On Thursday week, there is a Web2.0 conference in Dublin. There are many reasons for attending but two speakers make it a must see: 

* [Marc Canter](http://blog.broadbandmechanics.com/2006/04/two-dinners-dublin-426-and-amsterdam-55) of [Broadband Mechanics](http://www.broadbandmechanics.com/) is a legend in the tech world. His will not be a boring speech! This blog posting would not have been done in hCalendar format using the Structured Blogging plug-in if it was not for his infectious evangelism.

* Walter Higgins of [Sxoop](http://sxoop.com), creator of [PXN8.com](http://pxn8.com/) is a poster boy for how to avoid hot air and generate revenue from a product on day one. Walter is a great guy with a razor sharp mind.

Other speakers (from the Web2Ireland site) include:
Judy Gibbons, Venture Partner, Accel;
Jeff Clavier, SoftTechVC;
Daniel Waterhouse, 3i;
Nasser Batley, DRKW;
Adam Green, Dawinian Web
