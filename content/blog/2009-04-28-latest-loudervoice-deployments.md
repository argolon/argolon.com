We went live on [Puddleducks.ie](http://www.puddleducks.ie/) a few weeks back and the response has been fantastic.

Today [we went live](http://blog.loudervoice.com/2009/04/28/bubble-brothers-goes-live-with-the-new-loudervoice-reviews-widget/) with [Bubble Brothers](http://www.bubblebrothers.com/proddetail.php?prod=BRIG01) wine in Cork. They are the first users of our new SME customer reviews solution. This is a widget which can be dropped on a product page with one line of code and review-enables the entire site. No development is needed by the client and our simple job is to add the correct styling elements so that the widget blends with your site.
