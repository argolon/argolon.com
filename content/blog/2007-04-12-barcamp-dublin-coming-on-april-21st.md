Elly and the gang have been hard at work putting together [BarCamp Dublin](http://www.barcampdublin.com/) and it looks like a winner. This is the third one after Cork and Waterford and I love the look of the speaker line-up. If you are free at all on Saturday week I'd encourage you to head over. [Do sign-up](http://www.barcampdublin.com/attendees/) so they know how many people to expect.

Some of the talks that catch my eye include:



* Sean Mc Grath. Jython for fun and profit
* Paul Campbell. Agile Development with Ruby on Rails (or bringing about happiness in code)
* Sean O Sullivan, A look at the Voice 2.0 landscape
* Keith Bohanna & Tom Corcoran, Keith; GTD - my implementation of Getting Things Done, Tom; Spreading the Word - his experience of getting a team up to GTD speed



I dearly hope I can go, but we're in a race to get LouderVoice out the door so I'll have to decide closer to the day.

Just in case you don't know what BarCamp is:




<blockquote>BarCamp is an free informal gathering of people from technical and business backgrounds who wish to share their knowledge and learn from others. BarCamp has a policy of encouraging active participation in all discussions, rather than speakers simply preaching to silent crowds.</blockquote>
