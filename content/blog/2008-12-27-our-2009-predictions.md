The 2008 predictions weren't the most accurate. Let's see how we do for 2009.



* The Android platform will be absolutely huge. With Motorola, Sony Ericsson and a raft of Tier 2 manufacturers signed up, it will become _the _mobile platform from the mid to high end. Ignore the HTC G1, that's just a rough first attempt by one manufacturer. 
* Despite Android, iPhone will remain big. There is always that 10% of the market who like paying extra for "luxury" brands
* SaaS ecommerce providers will go mainstream. The idea of only selling locally will become ridiculous. Everyone who can send something by mail-order will end up online. SaaS will be utterly compelling for small biz like this.
* Facebook will continue to grow with people who neither know nor care what a Social Network is but want to keep in touch with people they know
* Facebook Connect will be everywhere
* Investors in pre-revenue Web2 companies will start losing patience and grab the management reins. In most cases this will fail
* Nice-to-have webapps that cost anything to run will disappear at an ever increasing rate
* The various Irish Government "throw money at VCs" schemes will continue to fail miserably
* Nothing will change in the structure of Enterprise Ireland and how it funds companies
* The Incubation Centres in Ireland will continue to be a source of a large number of successful start-ups
* Twitter will be sold for a lot less than expected as they fail to execute on a business model
* Smart BigCorps will hoover up tons of start-ups for petty cash and start building for the economic recovery
* All the Twitter clones will disappear
* All the major SocNets will add Twittter-like functionality
* At least one global location aware mobile SocNet will get decent traction
* Garmin and TomTom will be beaten up by GPS-enabled phones
* Google will make a play to own the yellow pages space using Google Maps. Everyone, including your chimney-sweep, will end up there
* Wifi will start becoming the norm in mid-range point-and-shoot cameras and everyone, including your mum, will start photo-sharing
* The proliferation of local review sites will end and a few big players will own the space in Europe
* More APIs will become pay-for as "Free" becomes a dirty word
* Sony will file for the Japanese equivalent of Chapter 11, sell off everything that is non-core, exit all JVs and continue to struggle to define itself in the 21st Century
* Sony won't create the PS4, a low-cost perfectly open platform, built around the web, media from-anywhere to-anywhere and open standards
* Sony won't create the PSPhone  
* BlueRay will remain a perfect solution to a problem which doesn't exist
* The Nintendo DSi will become the de-facto MP3 player for kids aged 3-15
* The DSi will be the catalyst to turn kids from consumers into generators
* Someone will build a GSM module for the DSi
* Someone will build a VOIP app for the entire Nintendo DS range
* Someone will provide solid internet access on the entire Cork-Dublin train line
* The Semantic web will remain something people write and talk about only
* The fastest growing webapp of 2009 hasn't been written yet
* More Irish start-up founders will move to Silicon Valley
* 2009 will be the hardest year for Irish start-ups since 2002
