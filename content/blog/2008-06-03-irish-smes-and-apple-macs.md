I've just been talking to a small local business that uses Apple Macs exclusively for all their computing needs. The owners expressed frustration over the lack of support they receive from state agencies in areas like training etc. In fact, they said that grants were offered at one stage to help small biz buy PCs but Macs were excluded!

These people almost felt like they were the only small biz using Macs in all of Cork. I refuse to believe that. It'd be great to hear about IT support people, accountants, trainers etc who have Mac expertise in the Cork area. Heck, would Apple not sponsor some local small business training on Macs to grow their SME customer base here?

I've been a Mac fanboy-baiter for many years calling them pretty toys. But to be honest I've seen more and more technical people switch to them as the perfect balance between the mainstream-ness of Windows and the power of Linux. I'm actually starting to fall for the story they tell. Seeing this client today express his joy at the ease of use of his iMac was particularly convincing. Also the discussion on anti-virus and security software was pretty short! Anyone want to lend me one for a week? :-)
