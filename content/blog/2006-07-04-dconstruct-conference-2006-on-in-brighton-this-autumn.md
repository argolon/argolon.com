[Walter Higgins](http://sxoop.wordpress.com/2006/07/04/anyone-going-to-dconstruct-in-september/) is wondering who is heading to the d.Construct conference in Brighton and asked if I'd repost here to see if we have a decent contingent. I'll be going as it sounds like last years event was a big success. They have an excellent lineup of speakers for this year.

To quote [the site](http://2006.dconstruct.org/):


<blockquote>
d.Construct is an affordable, one-day conference aimed at those building the latest generation of web-based applications. The event discusses how new technology is transforming the web from a document delivery system into an application platform.
