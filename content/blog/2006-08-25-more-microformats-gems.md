Carson Systems' [Vitamin site](http://www.thinkvitamin.com/) continues to impress me every day. The rate of new content is just about right, in comparison to some sites whose RSS feed is just a non-stop torrent of not very useful information.

They have just published [a very nice overview of microformats](http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/design/how-to-use-microformats) by John Allsopp which is a great introduction if you want to come up to speed.

If you are going to [dConstruct](http://www.dconstruct.org/) in Brighton in two weeks then you need to check out the [backnetwork site](http://dconstruct06.madgex.com) that [Glenn Jones](http://www.glennjones.net/) from [Madgex](http://www.madgex.com/) has put together. A superb example of the practical use of microformats. The wee Google Maps locator doo-dah is currently showing myself and Walter as the only attendees heading from Ireland. Surely not?
