It is still very early days over at [LouderVoice](http://www.loudervoice.com/) but I think the time is right to [announce the blog](http://blog.loudervoice.com/) and let people know bit by bit what we are up to. I doubt we'll be as open as Ryan and Gillian were with [BareNakedApp](http://www.barenakedapp.com/) but if something is interesting or useful then we'll blog it. 

We're not quite in a position yet to talk about exactly what the business is, so for the next while it'll be mainly contextual stuff associated with getting this new business off the ground in Ireland. I hope to see you all over at the new blog sometime soon.
