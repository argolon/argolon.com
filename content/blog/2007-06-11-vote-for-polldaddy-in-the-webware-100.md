Not just because it is [a brilliant product](http://www.polldaddy.com/) but also because [Lenny, Jonathan and the guys](http://www.infacta.com/) have shown that small Irish technology companies can have global reach! 

These guys pushed out 14 million polls last month and over half of them were non-English-language.

[Vote early and often](http://www.webware.com/html/ww/100/2007/publishing.html).
