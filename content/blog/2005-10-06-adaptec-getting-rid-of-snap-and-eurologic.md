Byte & Switch report that [Adaptec Says Sayonara to Systems](http://www.byteandswitch.com/document.asp?doc_id=81886&WT.svl=news1_1)

This is a sad end to the Eurologic story. We have watched them grow from a tiny operation in the early 1990's to their coup in getting an OEM deal with Dell. Then the mooted IPO, then the loss of the Dell deal followed by a fire-sale to Adaptec. At that point everyone thought they would be back on an upwards trajectory but it looks like it was not to be. Adaptec had a perception issue where they are still viewed as a vendor of PC SCSI cards and not much else. It appears that they never really managed to compete against more nimble operations like Engenio.

It is not clear how many people are still employed by the Eurologic division in Ireland but here's hoping they are bought by someone looking to carve out a decent chunk of the NAS space and providing proper competition to the deserved market leaders NetApps and EMC. 


UPDATE: EMC has just announced that they are getting out of the low-end NAS market too and getting rid of the NetWin boxes. Is anyone making decent money at the very low-end of this market?
