A workshop on the 2007-2013 Business Expansion Scheme (BES) and Seed Capital Scheme (SCS) will take place on Monday 12th November at 13:00 p.m. in the Rubicon Centre.

The Revenue Commissioners (Cillian Byrne & Susan Cummins) will be presenting and Gerry Oâ€™Brien, Enterprise Ireland will also be in attendance. Focused on startup and developing companies, the format is a workshop as it is intended to be interactive and give you plenty of opportunity for questions and answers.

Places are limited and strictly by registration so please register with Margaret Walsh mwalsh@gep.ie or (021) 492 8900

Mnay thanks to GEP and EI for arranging this, I know many of us are eager to hear the nitty gritty.
