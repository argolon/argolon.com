[Fergus](http://web2ireland.org/?p=102), [Paul](http://www.firstpartners.net/blog/location/dublin/2006/07/22/anybody-up-for-barcamp-ireland/) and [James ](http://eirepreneur.blogs.com/eirepreneur/2006/07/going_to_barcam.html)have all blogged about [BarCamp Ireland](http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland) already. I just bit the bullet and signed up to talk rather than just attend. I've a few things I can usefully contribute:



  1. My experiences so far with raising funding and dealing with state bodies (and 2002 vs 2006)
  2. Progress on outsourcing by the time BarCamp comes around (and purchaser vs vendor view)
  3. Microformats from a business perspective (no, I will not argue about XML)
