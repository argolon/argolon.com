I'm really pleased to announce that I've joined the [it@cork](http://itcork.ie/) steering committee. Since we founded Argolon Solutions, I've always found it@cork to be the real stand-out organisation nationally. I know other cities would love to replicate its success. It has always managed to strike that balance between meeting the needs of established IT organisations and the needs of start-ups.

I've already attended my first meeting and I was blown away by how much work is done by the committee and the various sub-committees. I'm looking forward to doing my bit in the coming year.

It you are in the technology business in Cork, then joining is a no-brainer. You should also make sure to let them know about all your news.
