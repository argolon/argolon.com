This is a very interesting announcement:

[OPSWARE INTRODUCES NEW GLOBAL SHELL TECHNOLOGY FOR CENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT OF LINUX, UNIX, AND WINDOWS
](http://www.opsware.com/news/pressrelease/08-08-05.html)
 You don't see much in the way of innovation in command-line shells but this looks extremely powerful. Cross-platfform, remote automation, supports all the leading current shells. Definitely worth a read if the scripted management of large-scale heterogeneous environments is something which daily breaks your heart.
