The first ShareIT session is tomorrow. Remember, it is totally free and you'll learn a bunch if you turn up. I've just finished writing my presentation on "Outsourcing - A Guide" and it's a cracker :-)

More info on the [Business Advisory](http://businessadvisory.ie/2007/03/23/shareit-cork-march-24th-almost-final-details/) site.

Contact Damien on 086 825 8586 if you want to attend.
