It has been over two years since the last one, but BarCamp is finally coming [back to Cork](http://www.barcampcork.com/). It's soon, very soon, only four weeks away. The venue is the lovely Webworks building in the City Centre, just like the last time.

We have a strong vision for this event and we need your help to make it happen on the day. Please read [the first set of posts](http://www.barcampcork.com/) and give us your feedback. If you think you'll be attending, please [register](http://www.barcampcork.com/register). As always with BarCamps, it is completely free with the costs being taken care of by our kind sponsors.

If you wish to sponsor or help, please read the "[what we need](http://www.barcampcork.com/2008/09/29/what-we-need/)" post.

We have two mottos for BarCampCork II "talking with, not talking at" and "less talking, more doing".

If you don't know what a BarCamp/Unconference is or have never attended one, here is a simple description from the main BarCamp site:


<blockquote>[BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/BarCamp) is an ad-hoc gathering born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from participants.</blockquote>



Every attendee of BarCamp is expected to contribute in some way. That doesn't necessarily mean you have to give a talk. But at the very least, you should take part in lots of the discussions that occur and share the knowledge you have in your area of expertise.

We'd love to see you down in Cork and we encourage anyone based outside of Ireland who reads this blog to consider flying in for the day.
