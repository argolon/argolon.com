[Phil Haack](http://haacked.com) (greatest ever surname for a geek), [has proposed some improvements](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/09/15/Proposed_Extensions_To_The_XFN_Microformat.aspx) to the [XFN microformat](http://gmpg.org/xfn/) including the most excellent fReNd-4-eVA.

He thinks he has serious issues with worrying about whether to mark someone as a friend or an acquaintance. What if you use "friend" but they use "acquaintance"? Rest assured that I have struggled with the same sad questions myself. I also worry that I'll be considered a bit needy if I mark someone as a friend too soon.

I think we'll need to have a session on this at [BarCampIreland](http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland) along with the future of virtualization in the data center. I know "dumped/dumped-by" will be a particular favourite.
