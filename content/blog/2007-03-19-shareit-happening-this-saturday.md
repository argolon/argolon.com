I previously mentioned the ShareIT initiative by the Irish Small Business Advisory Group and the first session is on this coming Saturday in UCC. Put simply 



<blockquote>ShareIT will offer free training by experienced business people who are experts in their respect areas to companies and individuals starting out in the world of IT. These training days are open to startup companies, companies with less than 10 employees and individuals considering starting an IT business.</blockquote>



The areas which will be covered in Cork include:



* Bootstrapping a small independent software vendor
* Effective communications
* How to use outsourcing to grow a small IT business
* Marketing research for Tech Startups
* Search Engine Optimisation for your website
* Managing web projects
* Sales in the IT environment


I'll be giving the presentation on "How to use outsourcing to grow a small IT business" based on many years providing outsourcing services and now making heavy use of them.

I strongly encourage you to sign up for this. It is completely free and I think all attendees will learn a lot and hopefully avoid many of the mistakes we all made in the same start-up situation.
