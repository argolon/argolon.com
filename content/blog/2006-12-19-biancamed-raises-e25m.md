My old UCD college buddy Conor Heneghan is co-founder of medical devices company [BiancaMed](http://www.biancamed.com/home/index.php) so [I was delighted to read](http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single7528) that they have just [secured serious external funding](http://www.thealarmclock.com/euro/archives/2006/12/irish_startup_raises.html). The work they did in the area of sleep apnea was really ground-breaking and they have progressed from this to come up with some really smart implementations and applications of their core IP. 

If the barrier to entry for Web 2.0 companies is very low, you would not believe how high it is for complex signal processing like this. Congratulations to the entire BiancaMed team in securing this funding and for showing how the commercialisation of University research should be done across the country.
