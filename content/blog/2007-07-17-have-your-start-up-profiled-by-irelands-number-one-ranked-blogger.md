If you have a tech start-up and despair sometimes (as I do) over the lack of local press coverage of your efforts then help is at hand. [Damien Mulley is offering](http://www.mulley.net/2007/07/17/tech-company-profiles-want-to-be-profiled/) to profile those who send him their company details. According to Technorati, he is the highest ranked blogger in Ireland and he also writes for the The Sunday Tribune so this can get you lots of interest. 

Who knows, maybe certain startup-clueless newspapers (yes I'm talking about you [Irish Examiner](http://www.examiner.ie/)) might even pick up on it.
