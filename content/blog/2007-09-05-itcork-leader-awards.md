This is such a great idea. 

On November 1, 2007 it@cork will have their first ever [Leaderâ€™s Awards](http://www.itcork.ie/index.cfm/page/leadersawards). They want to recognise some of the leading companies and individuals in the community and have an evening of networking, reflection and celebration.

There are 4 categories:




	  1. Emerging Company Award - to recognise a leading company in early stage business planning and execution
	  2. High Potential Award - to recognise a leading established company driving forward in international markets
	  3. R&D Project Award - to recognise a leading innovative research project within industry or third level college
	  4. IT Dept Award - IT departments who can clearly demonstrate business benefit from IT project implementations


The deadline for receipt of nominations is September 28, 2007 [so do it now](http://www.itcork.ie/index.cfm/page/submitleaderawardnomination). Unlike some other awards you don't have to pay to nominate!

To attend the evening event in Vertigo at County Hall [visit the website](http://www.itcork.ie/index.cfm/page/leadersawards) to register or contact catherine DOT wall AT itcork DOT ie to reserve a company table.
