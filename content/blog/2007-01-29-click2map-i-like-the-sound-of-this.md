I met Anthony Zanetti of [Hyliosoft](http://www.hyliosoft.com/) back in July at the Carson Workshop on "[How to Build a Web App](https://www.argolon.com/2006/07/24/carson-workshops-a-z-how-to-build-a-web-app/)". We had a lot in common in terms of background and, like me, he was hoping to build a Web App in the coming months. 

Well it looks like he has succeeded and the result is [Click2Map](http://www.click2map.com/). I don't know many details yet but it's basically a way of embedding custom Google Maps on your web-site with no programming required. It's one of those "why didn't I think of that apps?". Head on over to the site to sign up for the Beta which will be available in February.
