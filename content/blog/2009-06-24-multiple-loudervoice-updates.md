It's been a busy few weeks.



* Two years after LouderVoice launched with the aim to make reviews more useful via Microformats, [Google announced support](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-rich-snippets.html), followed quickly by several of our competitors. What took ye so long?
* Then we launched [Ireland's first Google Android Mobile application](http://blog.loudervoice.com/2009/05/23/loudervoice-reviews-for-google-android/)
* Then we enabled the [use of simple #review](http://blog.loudervoice.com/2009/06/24/ultra-simple-mini-reviews-on-twitter/) to identify mini-reviews on Twitter
* Then Krishna De of Biz Growth News[ released an extended interview](http://www.blogtalkradio.com/bizgrowthlive/2009/06/24/BGL-240609-Embracing-Ratings-And-Reviews-From-Your-Customers) with CEO Conor all about ratings and reviews.
* Finally, we've just been nominated in the new Europa Awards in the category of Best Web Application or Service (EMEA). [Public voting is here](http://uk.techcrunch.com/2009/06/24/the-europas-best-web-application-or-service-emea/).

We'll very shortly be announcing two more major LouderVoice upgrades for our business customers.
