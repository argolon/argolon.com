I'm grinning more than a cat that fell into a vat of cream. I've got through to the the voting round in four categories in The Irish Blog Awards! If you like my technology and business blogging between here, [LouderVoice](http://blog.loudervoice.com/) and the odd bit on my personal blog then [I'd love your vote](http://www.awards.ie/vote/) in the following categories:




* Best Technology Blog/Blogger 
* Best Business Blog



Don't forget to vote in the other categories too!
