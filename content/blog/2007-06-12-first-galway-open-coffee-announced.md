Aidan Finn [just announced Galway OCC on Twitter](http://twitter.com/aidanf/statuses/101294482). Upcoming.org page [here](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/3232/). I'd been hoping for this one, I think it'll be a big success. Looking forward to the reports. That plus [BarCamp Galway](http://barcamp.org/BarCampIreland4) are two great excuses for us to head up there.
