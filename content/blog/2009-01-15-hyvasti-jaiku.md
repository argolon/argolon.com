From [ReadWriteWeb](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/google_giveth_and_it_taketh_away.php), [Jaiku](http://www.jaiku.com/) is to be shutdown.

I know a lot of webapp businesses are bought by Google and die through lack of attention. In our innocence, many of us thought Jaiku would be different. We thought there was a masterplan. We thought Jaiku would be the heart of the Android Address Book. The ultimate mobile social network with millions of users instantly.

We were completely and utterly wrong. Jaiku was bought to get some amazing minds, like Jyri. There is no masterplan. Google still doesn't get Social Networks. Will it ever?

And anyone who thinks that OpenSourcing the Jaiku code will achieve anything is sadly living in lala-land.  The software is irrelevant in a Social Network, the people are what matters.

But pleaseeeeeeee Twitter, give us channels, pleeeeeeeease. I've avoided Saturday sport on TV for decades but I can't avoid it on Twitter.
